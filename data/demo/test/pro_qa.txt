3487	really ? that is so cool ! where does one go to find surfing competitions ?	competitions are usually held in the ocean . you can find one near you if you live near the ocean .
3489	i do , i always try to see how many questions i can get right . alex trabek is the host right ?	that is the one ! the show features a quiz competition in which contestants are presented with general knowledge clues in the form of answers
3490	that show has been on forever . i wonder whats the most money anyone has ever won on the show	i have heard that the original daytime version debuted on nbc on march 30 , 1964
3491	wow ! i didnt know it was that long . i had a jeopardy video game when i was younger	well the current version , a daily syndicated show produced by sony pictures television .
3493	i like vanilla flavoring too ! i especially enjoy vanilla syrup in my coffee when i make my espresso at home !	vanilla " , derived from , the diminutive of the spanish word ( " vaina " itself meaning sheath or pod ) , is translated simply as " little pod " .
3494	that 's pretty cool . it makes sense , since it does come in those little pods .	pre columbian mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid , called " tlilxochitl
3495	i imagine it has been around for many , many years then , huh ?	pollination is required to set the vanilla fruit
3496	i use to always want a siberian husky when i was younger they are so beautiful .	i have one . i use him as a sled dog .
3497	really so cool do you live in canada or somewhere where it snows ?	yes , i live up north in toronto . there are a lot of huskies here . people like them because of their fast pulling style .
3498	i seen them on movies when they pull the sleds they are originated in northeast asia wonder how they breed and got over where we could buy them .	i 'm not sure , but they are genetically similar to the gray wolf .
3499	they have this mysterious look though that gets me they look scary but i heard in actuality they are really good natured with everyone .	yes , many like to keep them as pets , and some people help find retired racing huskies new homes .
3501	i say i 'm going to do that every year and i never do . that sounds like fun .	the blueberry plants flower until they get the berries . there are a lot of varieties , but my son could easily pick them because the bushes are short . strawberry picking is fun too .
3502	i love blueberries and strawberries and they seem to taste even better when freshly picked . and i guess it 's cheaper to pick them yourself too .	i actually started because i figured it was cheaper . it is slightly cheaper , but not significantly . i think they secretly build in extra costs to pay for what your kid eats !
3503	that 's funny , but very true i guess . i would probably be just as bad as a kid my first time and give myself a stomachache .	ha ha ! i was bad my first time , too ! fruit picking is very social . in face , apple picking used to be a dating ritual in the midwest , where i live .
3504	that 's an interesting ritual . i used to live near an orchard growing up . brings back so many memories , but never went berry picking . i regret that now .	it 's never too late to start ! i recommend going early in the morning before it gets too hot .
3506	wow that is crazy ! what do you like most about them ?	i know and they come in all sizes from tiny geckos to 3 meter " 9 feet " komodo dragons . what 's not to like ?
3507	what type of lizard do you have ?	i have chameleon . it 's interesting watching his sit and wait for his food .
3508	oh i bet it is . they also can change colors based on their environment correct ?	have you heard of the draco , they can jump from trees and glide . i want one !
3509	i have n't heard of that one . unless it 's the one that has that neck that come puffing out . that is kind of cool looking	i think that 's a desert lizard . regardless they are mainly carnivorous just like me .
3511	yes they do ! have you ever had to deal with them . sometimes you get ripped off !	yea their main job is to diagnose the problem but sometimes they lie to make money
3512	yeah its no fun . i heard that even the licenced dealerships will rip people off too . i seen a documentary about it .	yea when they diagnose your car they will say other stuff is broken to make quick cash , very unethical
3513	it is . do you know much about cars ?	no i am not good at repairing or diagnosing anything in cars
3514	yeah that 's too bad . do you know much about bicycles ?	no i dont know about either to be honest but im ok with bikes
3516	i am not but i had no idea that it would be in the olympics !	so cool right ? i think tokyo will really get an interesting experience come july 24th , 2020 !
3517	so tokyo is where the next olympics will be help ?	yes that 's right , tokyo is the only asian city to host the olympics twice , lucky them !
3518	that is interesting ! do you know if the olympics has been held anywhere else in asia ?	oh definitely , they 've been held in south korea before and of course beijing in 2008 .
3519	i did not realize skateboarding would be an event is it freestyle or racing ?	probably freestyle , which is coming back into popularity after it 's peak from the 1960s until the early 1990s .
3521	actually i have not ! it just never sparked my interest . i dont even know what it is about ?	it is an adaption of a song of ice and fire
3522	oh okay ... yeah i have never seen that one either haha .	me either . it had 3 plots , a war for control , the rising threat of the others , and the ambition of the exiled heir .
3523	okay so is it placed in recent times or older times ?	it is a fantasy set in medieval times
3524	i 'm in love with indie rock !	i also love indie music . who is your favorite band ?
3525	artic monkeys and the strokes are my favorite .	i love the strokes . they have such a new york city vibe .
3526	i 've recently gotten into the killers . you should listen to abbey 's road .	i 'm obsessed with the killers . they 're latest album was surprisingly great it 's been a long road since hot fuss . i love the queen vibe .
3527	yes ! they absolutely have a queen vibe . i would honestly say they are one of the best groups right now !	jenny was a friend of mine is one of the greatest songs of all time specifically from their live at royal albert hall .
3528	they have a show coming up in switzerland on the 1st of july . i hope to one day see them live .	they just played in orlando a few weeks ago , i wanted to go but tickets were super expensive . i would give anything to see them play at royal albert hall again , it 's such an old venue from like the 1800s .
3529	i just saw a purple cloud . it was so cool .	purple is a color composite of the color violet , often confused for violet but it is n't .
3530	is it ? i did n't know that . and is that why it is so prety ?	it is pretty . violet is pretty as well but purple just seems more rich to me .
3531	is purple more rich ? does it cost more money ?	i meant rich in shade not in money , because it iis a color intermediate between red and blue .
3532	are those not the same thing . i always wondered ?	purple is similar to violet but purple is a combination of blue and red while violet is a spectral color that stands on its own .
3533	it sure does , and it looks good at night too .	i would absolutely agree . it does look good at night .
3534	carrots are definitely one of my favorite vegetables . they taste really good whether they are raw or roasted , which i love .	i love them too ! i 'm a big health nut , so i always eat them for their high amounts of alpha and beta carotene , vitamin k , and vitamin b6 .
3535	oh cool ! so which of those health components are what make them good for your eyesight , the carotenes ?	i 'm glad you asked that , because it gives me the opportunity to tell you that it 's actually a myth that carrots help your eyesight , started by the british in world war ii !
3536	really ? i always thought that the myth was that it helped your eyesight be clearer , but in reality it just improved things like your ability to see in low light over a long period of time .	i think it does n't help your eyesight at all , but i could be wrong . regardless , i do love carrots , even the yellow and purple varieties !
3537	i 've only really tried the orange ones . is there a difference in vitamins or taste with the yellow and purple ones ?	not taste , but there will be a difference in the phytonutrients ( nonvitamin compounds ) present , which are probably responsible for the difference in color .
3539	i think i have heard of that show , is that the one that they perform surgery on cats and dogs ?	not exactly , it is a fictional series that focuses on the lives of surgical interns
3540	so what do they perform surgery on if not cats and dogs ?	they perform surgery on humans the interns try to maintain personal lives and relationship
3541	ohhh that show , yea ive seen it . with mcdreamy and such	the characters that are in the show include cristina yang , izzie stevens , alex karev
3543	i have not done it before but it is definitely a sport i will love to try	have you heard of water skurfing ? that 's when you 're pulled along on a surf board instead of skis
3544	that sounds like so much fun . but it seems i have seen something of such on the tv	what is your favorite thing to watch on tv ?
3545	i love to watch the animal channels	me too , i really support the humane society of the united states too
3546	i like the music group the backstreet boys	really ? i do not , but i do know they are from orlando fl , formed in 1993
3547	i do n't like them as much now , but i listened to them a lot when i was young and they were a new group	i do like the fall out boys . they are an old group from chicago , way back in 2001 .
3548	i like them as well . i do n't think i heard of them though until a few years after that	i like nin , too . trent reznor put nothing records out of business in 2004 with a lawsuit against john malm .
3549	wow , do you know what the lawsuit was for ?	i do not , but they were a vanity label that lets the ' artist ' do stuff , part of interscope records .
3550	oh ok , i never knew that .	i like ok go , too . they are also from chicago , but they moved to los angeles .
3552	so , you are ready to quit working ? have you been doing the same thing for a while ?	unfortunately not however i guess you can consider me semi retired . i 've been asking for reduced hours .
3553	ahhh ... so you have been working part time . that can be fun ! you get a little free time throughout the work week .	yeah it 's been great ! i wish my personal housework and caring for children and pets was also considered paid labour though haha
3554	i know what you mean ! that is a full time job all by itself ! so what are you planning to do once you fully retire ?	i 'm going to travel around the world !
3555	i taught myself how to crochet a few years ago . i really enjoy it .	i have been doing it for years ! i remember when i was looking it up i misspelled it " crotchet " its the common name for a quarter note in music lol .
3556	that 's funny . what are your favorite things to make ? i am really only good at blankets and scarves lol .	i made a hat one time and a few scarfs over the years . crocheting is actually the process of interlocking loops of fabric pretty neat huh ?
3557	yes , it is cool how you can make something with a single string of yarn .	the name itself comes from a french word that means " small hook " . i always thought that was really neat .
3558	i did n't know that . i guess you learn something new every day .	the hooks that are used to crochet can be made out of almost anything but most commonly metal , wood , and plastic !
3559	do you like to watch association football ? i can n't wait for next season .	i just started getting into it a few years ago ! i figure , it 's the world 's most popular sport so it must be exciting ! i think that 's the reason over 250 million people play !
3560	it took me a few years to gain interest . turns out my eyes were going bad once i got glasses i could follow the ball easier .	yes , that would be difficult to see ! especially when you take into consideration there are eleven players on each team ! there 's a lot of places for that ball to hide !
3561	do you know how many countries have teams ?	association football is played in 200 countries ! is n't that remarkable ?
3562	that 's crazy i 'm guessing some of those places do n't even have running water but they have an association football team .	exactly ! the sport has been around for a long time , maybe that 's why . the laws of the game were originally drafted in england in 1863 !
3563	hello ! i have only bought honda civics in the past , they are my favorite car . have you ever owned one ?	no i have not but some of my friends have owned them . one of my friends had a honda del sol which was really cool .
3564	i havent been in that model before . i like all of the safety features . the first honda i owned was a hybrid , it got great gas mileage !	wow that is neat ! the del sol was the successor to the popular honda cr x , which another one of my friends owned . it was a fast hatch back also .
3565	that 's cool , i 'm looking for a hatch back next . they have anti theft locks also . but that was bad when i locked my keys in the car and the first locksmith could n't figure it out .	oh no that kind of stinks . i did not know thatthe second largest japanese automobile manufacturer in 2001 . that is impressive i think !
3566	well , not surprising , they are very dependable and lose their value slower than other comparable vehicles . i guess that 's why they are more expensive too !	oops i meant to say honda is . and apparently honda is eighth largest automobile manufacturer in the world . they are dependable for sure !
3568	me too ! ive been wanting to try some new pancake recipes ive been looking at , do you know when they invented pancakes ?	thats the thing they are old . evidence suggest that pancakes were the most widespread cereal food eaten in prehistoric societies .
3569	oh really ! thats neat , they are after all very easy to make and taste so good ! , did they have syrup back them like we do today ? what did they out on pancakes back then ?	no they did n't have syrup for a long time after , but pancakes were thin moist and filled with all kinds of nuts and fruits .
3570	that sounds great , i guess they had to make them sweeter with fruits instead of syrup so that makes sense . do you have a favorite pancake flavored syrup ?	nope i love cream cheese , chocolate and ground walnuts all natural !
3571	the bible is my favorite book . it 's pretty old , but it has some very interesting stories .	the bible is so interesting , its crazy that different christian groups have such differing attitudes about it !
3572	yeah ! there 's so many different interpretations by different christian groups . i wonder how far back it dates ...	i think pretty far since the new testament has collections of writings in it , written in the first century by koine greek
3573	that 's pretty old . who wrote the old testament ?	since the old testament includes books of the hebrew bible , i think it came from the jewish
3574	interesting ! but do christians only read the new testament ?	roman catholics , anglicans and eastern orthodox christians all believe the bible is very important and sacred
3576	i 've heard good things about it . how long has it been running ?	the series premiered on hbo in 2011
3577	cool where is the show set ?	well it is set on the fictional continents of westeros and essos
3578	interesting . i 've heard the show has a lot of deaths and violence .	yea the show follows a web of alliances and conflicts among the dynastic noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from the throne
3579	that sounds like a cool plot . what are some of the major families on the show ?	well one of the arcs centers on the longstanding brotherhood charged with defending the realm against the ancient threats of the fierce peoples and legendary creatures that lie far north
3581	yes ! i am a huge coffee nerd ! what do you like to get at starbucks ?	i love just getting the dark roast and adding my own creamer and sweetner . i did n't know they started in 1971 !
3582	that is older then i thought ! do they have a lot of locations ?	oh yes ! all over the country and i think in other countries ? i do like their white chocolate mocha on occasion .
3583	oh nice ! ! do you know where their headquarters are ?	in washington state ! it 's cool because you can also get chocolate treats inside the store .
3584	chocolate treats ? i didnt know that ! i usually go in the drive thru . what type of treats do they have ?	i know they have candy and chocolate coated marshmallows . plus chips and other goodies .
3585	oh i loved going on picnics when i was younger .	a picnic meal is so nice and family friendly , they really are a classic if you get a good lakeside setting .
3586	absolutely . i cant wait until i have kids and i can take them to picnics . those are great family memories .	yea picnics are great for enjoying a midday breakfast in the meadow .
3587	what 's your favorite picnic food ? anything specific ?	while many use picnics for breakfasts i prefer it for lunch for things like ham sandwiches or such .
3588	same here . sandwiches , meat cheese , and some fruit . that is all i need !	yep meat is always great in a picnic , they are classic in books and movies .
3589	yea , this reminds me . i have n't done a picnic in a long time !	yep ive never used a picnic as a romantic or intimate type of thing , but i havent had a family picnic since i was a kid
3591	no , what is the purpose of them ?	nursing homes provide residential care around the clock for elderly people .
3592	when were they first established ?	they began in the 17th century and were called poorhouses . they were brought to america by english settlers .
3593	i see , and is it expensive to stay in a nursing home ?	it is expensive , but a resident 's out of pocket expense depends on their insurance . medicaid funding is often used .
3594	interesting , and what are some examples of services offered by nursing homes ?	they offer food , shelter , medical services , planned activities , and housekeeping services .
3595	hello ! what does being a walmart stocker consist of ?	i 'm pretty sure you just put items on shelves . walmart has been around awhile . it was founded back in 1962 by sam walton .
3596	wow walmart is old . can you work a day shift as a walmart stocker or only a night shift ?	it is mainly night time , though i believe that you can do either or at their other company called sam 's club .
3597	oh interesting . how long has sam 's club been around if i may ask ?	it 's difficult to say really , but walmart alone has 11,703 stores !
3598	that is a lot . does walmart have stores in other countries besides america ?	all over the world ! most notably canada , argentina , chile , and brazil .
3599	nice . do you know who the ceo of walmart is ?	i do n't . but i do know that walmart has tons of negative allegations about it , such as bad environmental practices , foreign sourcing , and discrimination .
3600	i like the beatles band . do you ?	i like them , but i never really understood all of the " beatlemania " . i just do n't understand counterculture music .
3601	yes , i would n't say i would be part of the beatlemania , but i like quite a few of their songs .	i find it interesting that people were such big fans of the beatles that beatlemania continued to apart of pop culture even after they stopped performing in 1966 .
3602	the beatles	actually the first time i ever heard a beatles song was through rock band the music video game .
3603	yes , i guess falls in line with elvis and michael jackson fan types too !	and the drama that seems to surround some of the pop stars . apparently michael jackson was a topic of sexual activity at age 9
3604	yes , crazy huh !	i also just really appreciate how creative he was with name his house . neverland ranch is a pretty cool name do n't you think ?
3606	yes i completely agree ! i 've been vegetarian for many years now .	it 's not just about diet though . animals need to avoid suffering just as humanity does , and we should consider their interests as sincerely as we consider our own .
3607	yes this is true . do you know any groups that are famous for animal rights ?	i sure do ! the animal liberation front ( alf ) supports the extensions of legal rights and personhood to animals . they 're my heroes .
3608	interesting . i heard that in some countries , dolphins are being protected from being shown at marine parks as well .	yep , and the alf is the type of organization to clandestinely remove those dolphins from being at the marine parks in the first place . like an animal rights cia .
3609	that 's really great . i hope they can do the same at all zoos with all animals .	that 's true , except for flamingos . pretty to look at , but dirty , nasty creatures deserving of their captivity .
3611	oh i bet you do ! do you ever get tired of the endless blond jokes though ?	nope , i have a high iq and a good job so i know it 's not true . i love my hair of yellowish color .
3612	it 's nice to know that the jokes are just jokes and are not true to real life , then . do you ever color your hair a different color ?	blonde is an old english term that means faeger feahs " or blonde hair to define those to the north . no , i 'm scottish so i like to embrace my heritage .
3613	that makes sense , for some reason it 's easy to picture people exposed to cold and snow to be blond or white haired . maybe it 's because everything is white up there !	we get much less sun here . maybe that has something to do with it . further south in italy some say that blonde came from medieval latin " blundus " , meaning " yellow " and was also describing those to the far north .
3615	how long has parenting been around ?	since big baby jesus ! , parenting refers to the intricacies of raising a child aside from the biological relationships
3616	so can i be a parent even if i do n't have my own biological kid ?	yes you can ! you can care for younger silblings , a grandparent can parent their grandkids , or you can also be a legal guardian , an aunt , uncle or other family member or friend of the family
3617	does my sister saying she has furry babies ( dogs ) count as being a parent ?	if you all are into freaky things like that then sure , but in many cases , orphaned or abandoned human children receive parental care from non parent blood relations
3618	are orphanages still a thing in america ?	yes there are still children raised in foster care or even orphanages called residential treatment centers
3620	yes i do . i actually have wifi .	yeah i do not think i could go back to the msn dial up internet days .
3621	me either . those days were the worst ! it 's crazy how much technology has improved over the years .	yes it is amazing how much even cell phones have advanced within a short time . msn dial up still exists for those areas who cannot access high speed broadband .
3622	i love my iphone i would n't trade it for the world . i hope one day they will update the areas who still have to have msn dial up .	i know . people in the us are fortunate to have the foundation for the worldwide internet that we enjoy now , but i can only imagine how other countries barely have msn dial up to use .
3623	the worldwide internet is a great tool to have i believe everyone needs to have it .	yes , everyone should have information available at their fingertips , whether on a computer or a cell phone . the future is technology knowledge .
3625	yes i like so much	i love going to nightclubs on friday and saturday nights . they 're pretty quiet the rest of the week .
3626	yes is very lovely to go this day in this party with my best friend	i always go with my best friend as well . but the night clubs in my city have a dress code : no ripped jeans or gang clothes . it 's really annoying .
3627	yes is very true and i believe in this choise and it is a good idea	our local nightclubs have a vip area for celebrities and their guests . but no celebrities live in my city , so they are always empty !
3628	i love swimming ! especially when it 's hot outside	do you do it for recreation , sport or exersize ?
3629	usually for recreation . i go to the pool with my son	does he take swimming lessons ?
3630	no , he is only 1 . i really want him to learn how to swim !	most people think that infants are born with the ability to swim but it 's not true
3631	that 's really good to know !	swimming is definitely low impact compared to land activities such as running
3633	yes ! i love to go go kart riding . do you like to build them yourself ?	no , i think i could only build a soap box derby cart , the ones that just go downhill haha
3634	haha that is funny ! ive built one with my dad when i was younger . it was alot of fun . do you like to race ?	did you use a four stroke engine or an electric motor ? some people use 2 stroke engines . i like to race them , but i am not good !
3635	we used an electric motoro . im not ery good at the racing part , but i love to watch the races .. of all kinds !	i know two stroke engines have two pistons usually . that is the extent of my go kart building knowleedge . i do love to play mario kart though !
3636	mario kart is the funnest game ever ! im totally a nintendo girl 100 . mario and donkey kong are my all time favorites .	the series has sold 100 million games worldwide , that is insane . i love nintendo , i got a nintendo switch awhile ago , hugely recommend , best system ever !
3637	in my free time i like to day dream about cafes in paris .	parisian caf s started in the 17th century and are a good place to network .
3638	in my free time i like to day dream about cafes in paris .	have you been to the popular caf de la paix in paris ?
3639	oh , interesting ! i like the idea of being in an atmosphere where its very cozy and comfortable to be in .	yes , cafes in paris even have a wine selection if you like to relax .
3640	no i have not , but i would love to . what makes it so popular ?	it is just one of the most recognizable caf s .
3641	oh wow . i 'm sure the wine there is really good too ,	yes , but i suggest drinking at the bar because its cheaper than drinking at a table .
3643	oh cool . what do you spend most of your day doing ?	working on surface ships , amphibious ships , as well as submarines
3644	so are you a mechanic for these ships ? or those are the types of ships that you stay on while at sea ?	yes the role of the nay is strategic to protect sea lanes , ports etc
3645	what is the importance of these sea lanes and ports ?	sea traffic basically the strategic task of the navy may include nuclear weapons
3647	no i have not . who is he ?	he 's a character in the animated movie " cars . " mcqueen is an anthropomorphic stock car and the movie was animated by pixar films .
3648	i have n't see that movie yet . is it any good ?	it was released in 2006 and is a comedy adventure film suited for the whole family , adults and kids . and yes i loved it .
3649	i will have to look it up . is it on netflix ?	not too sure , you 'll have to check it out . netflix does specialize in video on demand online so i do n't see why they wouldn'y have it .
3650	maybe i 'll watch it with my roommate tonight . thanks for suggesting it !	no worries , you 'll love it . watch it on netflix , this company was founded by reed hastings and marc randolph .
3652	i have never played either . what does fretted mean ?	it means fragile instrument , it is also an instrument that has six strings
3653	interesting . i guess it is fragile . when were guitars created ?	i do n't really know but i know thatmodern guitar was preceded by the gittern , the vihuela , the four course renaissance guitar
3654	i have never heard of those instruments . do they all look similar ?	somehow , there is one that is traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut , nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones
3656	that sounds like fun , what is your favorite type of fictional stories ?	they are called alternate history , for example if germany won wwii instead of the allies .
3657	i love stories like that when they put a crazy twist on past events , it also makes for a good movie idea .	yeah , they make you think " what if " and analyze history that way .
3658	indeed it really brings in new ideas and makes you think what if it really happened that way .	one way this can be used is in applied history , which takes lessons from the past and applies them to making decisions today .
3659	hi ! i cannot wait until football season starts up again ! they better be training now and getting ready !	i know , i just love football ! it 's played by 250 million players in over 200 countries !
3660	wow ! association football is both soccer and football . it is the most played sport in the world .	i always wondered where the name " soccer " came from . it 's an abbreviation of " association " ( from " assoc . " ) is n't that interesting ?
3661	it is cool i guess ... i like that they been involving women for a long time . england in 1894 had a team the british ladies ' football club .	that 's great . women 's football in england has seen a large increase since the 1990s .
3662	despite being more popular than some men 's football events ( one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd ) , 60 women 's football in england suffered a blow in 1921 when the football association outlawed the playing of the game on association members ' pitches , on the grounds that the game ( as played by women ) was distasteful .	wow . the england national football team 's first international match was in 1870 .
3664	i am a fan . i like how upbeat it usually is . do you have any favorite artists ?	i 'm not that familiar with edm but i know it 's generally produced for djs who create mixes for nightclubs and events . who are your favorite artists ?
3665	i really like the chainsmokers and avicii . i think edm is really good to workout to since it 's so fast . what kind of music do you generally listen to ?	avicii is from switzerland is true is the debut album produced . i like all kinds of music really , i 'm pretty eclectic .
3666	it 's really sad that avicii committed suicide earlier this year because he was so talented . i did n't realize he was from switzerland , thanks for filling me in on that !	tim bergling was his birth name . i did n't realize he had committed suicide and he was actually from sweden . i misspoke .
3668	i love walmart too ! it is a very convenient place to shop for literally everything . what do you shop most for ?	honestly food ! i love how large of a section of food they have . they also tend to have ethnic things that i love to use .
3669	yes , you are right about that its certain things you can not find in other places . for instance my daughter and i really love strawberry syrup and walmart only sales smuckers .	one of my favorite things too is that walmart owns sam 's clubs . i feel that 's great !
3670	yes that is amazing ! i love sam 's too , especially on sundays when they hand out samples of food . would it be selfish of me to ask for them to create a rewards program	i would love it if they had a loyalty program ! they already have the cards set up so it would be really easy to make one ! they could even tie it into walmart shopping too !
3672	they have a unique shaped mouth that allows them to carry delicate objects like eggs	they retrieve shot waterfowl such as ducks and upland game birds
3673	hounds are stellar for that too , very good bird hunting dogs	n many western countries , commercial waterfowl hunting is prohibited ,
3674	i can understand why , they are an easy species to ovrhunt	also , is possible to take different species of waterfowl in the same outing .
3675	yeah cheney went for quail and he got a bush instead	cheney attended yale and then the university of wyoming
3677	i love my honda . i have a pilot and it 's the best car i 've ever had .	have you ever considered purchasing from their dedicated luxury brand , acura ?
3678	my husband has thought about it , but we 've never bought one .	they were launched in the us and canada in 1986 . i 've seen them , they are nice
3679	we 've looked at a few , but decided to go with the pilot .	everyone would be suprised by how surrounded they are with honda engines , be it garden equipment , generators , or other engine driven products .
3680	it 's been a great car for us , i 'm very impressed with their workmanship .	how long have you had your pilot ? did you buy it new ?
3681	i want to learn to salsa dance one day .	it 's a very popular form of social dance.do you know where it originates ?
3682	it has become more soicalable then ever you see it every where now and i believe it was the caribbean right .	yes , haha . however the movements of salsa have origins in puerto rico , do you know which dances salsa takes it 's movement from
3683	no not really , and i know the puerto ricans and latinos use it alot but many do n't know it was first originated in caribbean and people be confused alot .	yeah , there is some confusion around it . but the salsa takes its moves from the bomba , plena , cha cha cha and mambo . can you do any of those moves ?
3684	my best friend is from ecuador so they do alot of salsa dancing her and her family did teach me the bomba and cha cha lol do you salsa dance much ?	oh , no , i do n't but i enjoy the salsa music that originated in the mid 1970s in new york
3685	i do like the music as well it is so upbeat and soothing that 's what makes the salsa dancing so fun and the dancers be moving quick on their feet .	haha , yes , you 'd probably enjoy a salsa dance social than , commonly held in night clubs , bars , or ballrooms
3687	i love eating pizza ! i do n't know a single person who hates it .	they can be topped with so many things too , like meat and vegetables .
3688	that is what makes pizza so special . you could put whatever you want on it and it will still be delicious .	exactly ! i love meats like pepperoni and vegetables like mushrooms .
3689	those are great toppings . is it a popular dish around the world ?	pizza is super popular everywhere , especially with all types of different toppings . whether they 're meats or vegetables .
3690	interesting ! i bet it is eaten a lot in america .	yeah it is really popular over here in america , even without cheese on it .
3692	i agree with the no kill , i wonder if the federal government can adopt some basic laws for all	the humane society of the united states is a non profit that tries very hard to push those laws but have not yet been successful in a formal regulation nationwide .
3693	but are no kill shelters viable , it seems they would become overrun if they run out of space to house animals	they do many times and have to limit the intake because of that . they will only euthanize if the animal is very sick or a great danger to society .
3694	its sad they have to , but how can a person like me get involved if there are no shelters were i live	well there is always options like donating money to the aspca or a local humane society as it all has the same common goal to save as many animals as possible .
3696	starting as a small stand and now mcdonalds is the worlds largest restaurant chain by revenue . that 's huge !	they decided to revamp their business as a hamburger stand . i know it was my first experienced with a fast food burger ! lol
3697	ray kroc was the business mastermind that lit the fire that blew them up . that was a dramatic part of the mcdonalds story .	yes ! he joined the team in 1954 and he turned the chain into a nationwide and global franchise making it the most successful fast food franchise in the world .
3698	mcdonalds was the food equivalent of disneyland for me as a kid . the playground and toy , not to mention the jingle that i still know by heart .	i loved the golden arches which were launched at at a location in phoenix , arizona ! i also remember that jingle as i memorized it when i was a kid ! lol
3699	ronald mcdonald is the only clown that never scared me , and love that he represents the ronald mcdonald house that helps so many .	i totally support the ronald mcdonald house charities which support children but i am like you ... actually ... all clowns scare me ! lol

3707	oddly enough i 've never seen the godfather 2 , or 3 . i know it 's a legendary series though . i need to check them all out .	they are iconic if nothing else they even have a video game series based on the 1974 film
3708	was the video game released on pc , consoles or both ?	i think they were released for the consoles
3709	do you know much about breweries	it is a business that makes beer and sells it
3710	i see , i 'm sure they have a lot of history to them	actually , the first record of brewing beer for sale was way back in 2500 bc
3711	i see , that 's earlier than i thought	brewing used to take place in the home , but by the 9th century monasteries and farms started producing it on a mass scale
3712	ah right , monasteries liked their alcohol	it gives them something to do . there are many diverse was to make beer and production methods
3714	i have not but i live in the northeast , i have just never made it up that far !	boston is new england 's largest city , and their football team is the new england patriots , are you a patriots fan ?
3715	i am definitely not , i am a philadelphia eagles fan , we finally beat them good this year , i was so happy !	oh the eagles are the football franchise out of philadelphia ! that was such an exciting super bowl !
3716	i was not excited , i was so scared the whole game , the patriots always pull off something , no lead feels safe with them	yeah it was a great game , were you aware the eagles franchise began in 1933 ?
3718	i think so back in the day , they are not still producing music are they ?	i think they 're still together , which is pretty amazing considering the band was formed all the way back in 1981 !
3719	what was the best selling album ?	it 's hard to say for sure . master of puppets , their third album , is thought to be one of the most influential thrash metal albums . their fifth album , metallica was very popular with mainstream america , selling over 16 million copies .
3720	what awards did they win ?	i 'm not sure if they 've won any grammys , but they are considered to be one of the founding " big four " bands of thrash metal !
3721	any number one hits ?	i do n't think they had number one hits , per se , but the metallica album peaked at number one for album sales in 1991 . it was the best selling album of the soundscan era !
3722	i really enjoy going to stand up comedies on weekends .	stand up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience , usually speaking
3723	yea thats what i like about it . it feels more personable and upfront .	the performer is commonly known as a comic , stand up comic , stand up comedian
3724	do you like amy schumer . she is a famous comedian .	yis ( born june 1 , 1981 ) is an american stand up comedian , writer , actress , and producer from new york
3725	i see , is she a rather controversial figure ?	in stand up comedy , the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories , jokes and one liners typically called a monologue ,
3726	if chicken has light and dark meat , do people too ?	i 'm not sure , but i suppose you could ask someone from fiji since it was known as teh " cannibal isles " .
3727	oh , it was , eh ? i might have to look into going there .. i 'm quite curious .	did you ever see cannibal holocaust ? ? it 's pretty brutal , it was made in 1980 . deodato directed it .
3728	no ! a lot of interesting stuff seems to have come out of the 80 ' s though	yeah it was mostly filmed in the amazon rainforest and they actually used indigenous tribes as actors .
3729	they did n't actually eat people in the movie , did they ? like , was it a documentary ? ?	no , it was a horror movie but was based on news reports deodato had heard and though may have been fake . it 's crazy . if you have a strong stomach , check it out .
3731	that is true . are you a fan of green either ?	i like green but blue is my favourite . blue is actually between violet and green on the spectrum .
3732	yeah . i like green because it 's close to trees and nature .	blue has an aqua , marine kind of feel . the eye perceives blue when observing light .

3737	is that really is full name ? i had no idea	yes and he was born october 4 , 1861
3738	do you like mcdonalds ? i used to love them until the past few years	i loved them way back when ! they were founded in the 1940s in san bernardino , california . i am not crazy about them anymore .
3739	that 's how i feel . prices are high and quality is down .	it 's hard to believe they are the world 's largest fast food chain in revenue serving 69 million people daily ! they are in over 100 countries ! i guess somebody likes those nuggets ! lol
3740	they do get a lot of business yet i know tons of poeple that do n't like them	in response to customers complaints and the unhealthiness , they are adding to the menu with items like salads , fish , smoothies and fish .
3741	i have noticed a change in menu items . also , a bump in costs . my daughter absolutely loves them	yes ! kids love them ! lol of course kids love burgers , chicken nuggets , french fries and milkshakes which is what mcdonalds is best known for !
3743	my brother in law used to drive a hazardous materials truck until he got a dui in his personal truck .	truck drivers are responsible for their inspections on their vehicles mechanical items and issues to safe operations .
3744	i would hope so , but with all the blown tires all over the interstates , it seems they need to do some additional inspections	usually 3 types of drives . their are owner drivers , and owner operators . there is also company drivers .
3745	what is the difference ?	other such as sales drivers and workers . they can do additional services such as prepaeration , cleaning and entertaining with regards to cooking .
3747	that 's interesting . what talent did you perform ?	i did a mix of singing and dancing , some people there did martial arts , it was pretty cool .
3748	oh wow ! are you formally trained in music or dance in anyway or has it just been a hobby	just a hobby , but i 'd like to go on shows like the voice or got talent at some point if possible .
3749	that would be amazing . maybe one day . who won the show ?	i 'm not sure who won those most recently , i know mo adeniran won the voice uk version at one point .
3750	i 'm sorry . i was not clear . i was referring to who won the talent show .	oh sorry my fault , it was someone who played an entire song by himself , as in he played the drums , guitar , and sang vocals all at once , it was crazy .
3752	ok what 's the history ?	it was founded by french colonists in 1702
3753	ok , any tourist site	i 'm not sure but one thing im sure of is that the capital is montgomery .
3754	ok , is there a beach , i love the view	i am sure that you already know that it is also the heart of dixie " and the " cotton state
3755	which sports do you like or participate in ?	i like ultimate frisbee . it 's a non contact team sport .
3756	i love watching soccer i dont miss to see the matches	ultimate frisbee was developed in 1968 by a group of high school students in maplewood , new jersey !
3757	aunch the frisbee to the winner of the coin toss . after dividing into two even teams and going over the basic rules , pick which team will start with possession .	points are scored by passing the frisbee to a teammate in the opposing end zone .
3758	two teams of seven players compete on a playing field about the same length as a football field , but narrower . ... each team defends one endzone . they score a goal if one of their players catches the disc in the opposite end zone .	that 's correct ! players also must be careful to not take steps while holding the disk .
3759	the average salary for mlu players is about 25.00 per game and has been that way for the same way for the last three years the league has been around . ... the average salary in the audl is about 850 a year to 1500 a year which is still much more than mlu players	that is so little compared to players of other sports here in the united states !
3761	is that the famous seattle that is known for being rainy ?	i am unsure , i just know that it is the largest city in washington and the pacific northwest .
3762	if it 's the city i 'm thinking of , my friend took a trip there recently . he said it was great and a large city as well .	it is located on the seaport of the west coast and is fun to visit !
3763	what about it would make it a fun place to visit ? i have heard it 's fun but i do n't know why .	as of july 2016 it is one of the fastest growing cities in the united states , so one wold assume fun stuff is there !
3764	i havebeen wanting to teach school , and i have just accepted a job as a teacher !	nice its really important work an elementary school is the main point of delivery of primary education
3765	yes , i am happy to get the job but i wish you would educate me about what to expect .	well in the fall of 2009 almost 3.5 million students attended public primary schools , so you are going to have a crowded class :d
3766	wow ! i thought i would only have about 20 . they must have some large classrooms .	learning standards are identified for all areas of a curriculum by individual states , so you need to have a lot of knowledge also
3767	i hope i can do this . now you have me worried . is geography a hard subject to teach ?	its really hard learning standards are elements of declarative , procedural , schematic , and strategic knowledge , really complicated
3768	no matter what i do , i always seem to be running late .	running late , delaying arrival is known as tardiness , not a good quality
3769	i agree , it adds quite a lot of stress into my life .	tardiness at school , work or appointments is often punishable in some way
3770	yes , i have had consequences from my tardiness . i was written up at work for it .	i am just the opposite and arrive early so i am punctual !
3771	that is good , what tips do you have for someone like me ?	make it a priority because legally you can be fired for repeated tardiness
3772	i love techno music , have you listen to any great techno artists lately ?	i know some mainstream edm artisis , probably not techno though . heard of diplo or gta ?
3773	has diplo been around for long . i do enjoy their music	he got prett big around 2013 with his ep " revolution . "
3774	oh i see , i have n't heard of that album , any popular songs from it ?	the song " revolution " from it is pretty popular . it 's got some house influences to its sound .
3775	are there any main differences between house and techno music ?	house was more influenced by disco and is mechanical in its sound .
3777	oh i know , i love van halen !	the band was formed in pasadena , california , in 1972 .
3778	wow that 's quite a while ago !	yes it is , they only existed from 1974 until 1985
3779	why did the band disband then ?	i 'm not sure but they were one of the most successful rock acts of the time .
3780	must be why they got so popular !	" 1984 " was their most successful album
3781	hey ! a friend of mine just moved to colorado after we made plans to become roommates for college . have you ever been ?	yes , i do love those landscapes , forests , deserts , canyons , etc . very pretty .
3782	yeah , i agree . it makes every step outside very relaxing and when i bring my dog for walks , it 's always great to look at the scenery . although , i do n't like being in pst as a lot of my friends are in est .	it is apparently the 8th largest state in the country .
3783	is it really ? huh , that 's surprising . i 'm closer to the southern part of it and have n't really ventured out . are there any other fun facts i should know ?	indeed , the population is approximately 5,540 , 545 as of 7 1 16 , a 10.17 increase over 6 years .
3784	wow , haha . guess it 's gonna be hard to find a job !	yes ! have you been to the four corners where four states join ?
3785	no , i have n't . what are the states ?	arizona , utah , colorado and new mexico make the four corners .
3786	i love to fish . i grew up with my dad who was a fisherman .	was he a recreational fisherman or was he a professional ?
3787	he was a recreational fisherman . could have probably been a professional . do you like to fish ?	i do n't mind fishing but i can find it very boring . i know lots of recreational fisherman though .
3788	i agree , it can be boring just sitting there waiting for a fish to bite . that is why i bass fish only . you do not have to just throw your line in and wait .	what is the process with bass fishing then ? i am uneducated on this .
3789	many have their own techniques but i use a plastic worm and you throw it in and reel it back slowly and kind of jerk slightly as you are reeling to catch bass	i heard that bass fishing is quite popular the black bass is the most specifically sought after game fish in the usa .
3790	i love fishing i just wish i could be better at it	there are different techniques such as spearing , netting , angling and trapping do you do any of those ?
3791	no i just do angling but my dad has used a net in the past !	there are a lot of people that do it for a living according to statistics there are about 38 million fishermen and fish farmers in the world .
3792	i had no idea they had that many ! is it true for deep sea fishing you need a special licenses .	a fishing license is basically a mechanism to control fishing . my husband and daughter went to fish at the beach in florida and we did have to have a salt water fishing license on top of their fresh water one .
3793	that is very interesting i guess no matter where you go they want to know what you are doing .	there is even such a thing as rc fishing ! if you can attach a line to a remote control boat , any rc boat can be used . i guess that 's a new way to do it .
3794	that would be really cool to do ! i will have to look into that	you have to make sure it 's big enough to not be pulled down , visible from long distances , can handle bad weather , waves and wind , etc ..
3796	i love blue as well . i especially like blueish green seafoam shade and baby blue !	yes it reminds me of the clear daytime sky .
3797	me too , it 's so beautiful , and the same with like an ocean blue , it 's so soothing .	i also like blue eyes , caused by the optical effect called tyndall scattering
3798	i happen to have blue eyes myself . i did n't know about tyndall effect , what is it ?	wow , you 're so lucky ! the tyndall effect , also known as willis tyndall scattering , is light scattering by particles in a colloid or else particles in a very fine suspension
3800	is that true ?	apparantly . the first law regulating dentistry were french
3801	that 's interesting . what else went on in france in those days lol	i do n't know . i do know that filipino barbers also performed dentistry
3802	that 's pretty crazy . i have to imagine there were a lot of injuries back then ?	i 'd imagine . it was also common that barbers performed surgery
3803	wow ! that just sounds like a bunch of deaths waiting to happen .	barbers perfomed the surgery , because they had the razors
3804	the royal ballet is something ive never seen .	well if you 're american the chances are low , since they are from london england .
3805	makes sense , royal isnt used much around here haha .	i bet hahah the royal ballet was founded in 1931 so that explains the name
3806	doesnt seem very old for england .	yeah you 're right . the royal ballet is one of the world ' famous ballet companies so that 's pretty cool
3807	oh yea i bet it makes a lot of money and fame .	well they employ 100 dancers so you can imagine how big this thing is ! ! !
3808	i absolutely love cheesecake ! what about you ?	yes i love cheesecake it is a seet dessert consisting of one or more layers
3809	yes , the more layers the better , am i right ? haha	yes i know have you ever had elis cheesecake in chicago it supposed the be the most famous in the city
3810	oh , i have n't . have you ?	yes i have also a good place to go to is the cheesecake factory . it is a restaurant that sells cheesecake in the us
3811	oh , yes , i 've been there before , they have great food too !	yes they are really good the company owns and operates 208 full service restaurants .
3812	oh wow , how many cheese cakes do they sell ?	i bet its alot you can even buy theri cheesecakes in barnes and nobles stores
3813	are honda vehicles safe ?	i had a honda and always felt safe , how about you ? have you ever had a honda ? they are the world 's largest manufacturer of cars after all !
3814	i rented a honda for two years and had some issues .	oh no ! what type of honda was it ? i had a honda fit , the hybrid petrol electric version
3815	it was an accord , and a pretty nice one .	i loved accords ! i liked the sixth generation accord , especially the two door coupe
3816	it is quite possible mine was just a lemon others have good experiences like you .	yes i 've always had good experiences with honda !
3817	there are many good car manufacturers . i currently have a bmw .	bmw is awesome ! technically it stands for " bayerische motoren werke " , or " bavarian motor works " in english
3818	lately i have been thinking of getting back into digital art	you should ! i 've heard that digital art is mostly being called " media art " now .
3819	that sounds like a better name for it	i agree . when you get back into it , you should try time based media art , something with an actualy duration and timeline
3820	ok that sounds nice , i 'll have to look into that , i 'm not familiar with it	you could always find a university that offers a course in " new genres " or " new media " . that could really help you !
3821	i 'm going to look into that right away . is there any basic topics i need to study ?	you could always focus on maybe gaming or making mobile apps ? there is a gaming company called oddworld inhabitants that might be hiring !
3823	border collies are nice . how old is yours ?	shep is 4 and was bred for intelligence and obedience
3824	oh wow .. how smart are they ?	highly intelligent and many experts say they are the most intelligent dogs
3825	wow i figured it was the german shepard or something	border collies are very athletic and extremely energetic makes them good herding dogs
3826	what types of herding do they do ?	mine herd sheep , goats , cattle and pigs
3827	i sometimes have trouble sleeping at night . is this something i should be worried about ?	you could have insomnia , it is a sleeping disorder .
3828	is there something that i can do about it ? what kinds of treatment are available ?	i believe there may be some alternative medicine that could work . although none of that is scientifically proven to work .
3829	what is your sleeping pattern like ? do you have trouble sleeping too ?	i usually only have trouble sleeping from jet lag .
3830	oh , yes . i hate jet lag . sometimes it takes me a week to recover from a long flight .	you ever had any sleep inversion issues ? like reversing your normal sleeping tendencies .
3831	i love dark chocolate	me too ... i recently learned that it 's made from cocoa butter instead of milk based butter , which is what milk chocolate is made from .
3832	it is also healthier , a 100 gram bar has 11 grams of fiber	cool ... and granola ( especially if it has flax seeds ) can improve digestion , so a dark chocolate flavored granola bar would work wonders .
3833	but you have to be careful because people for get , the " purer " the chocolate gets the more bitter it becomes	true ... cacao has been cultivated in mesoamerica for around 3,000 years . i wonder how sweet or bitter their chocolate was back then ...
3834	actually the discovery of cacao residue on pottery excavated in honduras that could date back as far as 1400 b . c . e .	that is interesting ! i 've read that the aztecs believed cacoa was a gift from the gods , and at one point they even used the seeds as currency !
3835	i was thinking of starting a small business , do you know anything about those ?	well they are privatly owned corporations that have few emplouees and less revenue than larger corporations .
3836	that makes sense , are there any special regulations for small businesses ?	the us classifies small buisness as any buisness with fewer than five thousand employees .
3837	interesting , i would n't really consider that small myself , but i 'm not the government . do you know anything else ?	well small buisness can usually apply for government support and have preferential tax policies . you may want to check it out .
3838	that sounds like useful information , do you know anything more specifically about that ?	well tax policy is really complicated and effects the distribution of income and wealth .
3840	i guess i never knew the un got involved in defining orphans .	many bodies try to . in the us the definition requires separation or loss of both parents .
3841	yes . it must be awful to be an orphan . does the un help orphans ?	they try to , and have helped some become writers , world leaders and entertainment figures .
3842	i 'm glad to hear they concern themselves with the less fortunate .	i know one orphan who was a distinguished alumni of columbia university
3843	i just love the beach do you know anything about it 's coral reefs ?	well the particles composing a beach are typically made from rock , such as sand , gravel , shingle , pebbles , or cobblestones .
3844	where do those materials come from ? are they washed up from the ocean ?	they are mostly biological in origin , such as mollusc shells or coraline algae .
3845	do any animals live on the beach ?	yea well they typically occur in areas along the coast where wave or current action deposits and reworks sediments that can contain crawfish and crabs
3846	i just love to eat crabs for dinner . i wonder what attracts them to the area .	coconut crab is the largest land living arthropod in the world , and is probably at the upper size limit for terrestrial animals with exoskeletons in recent times .
3847	i wonder how big these animals could have gotten in ancient times .	these crabs are found in indonesia , island across the indian ocean and parts of the pacific coeans as far east as the gambier islands mirroring the distribution of the coconut palm .
3849	oh thats good . i just got married and i 'm hoping to be a parent soon so any useful information will help :)	that would make sense , especially since obviously the most common caretaker for a child is the biological parent .
3850	yes , talking about caretaker , myself and my wife are very busy career people , i 'm wondering how we will be able to manage . do you think hiring a nanny can ease the job ?	i guess that depends on if you can afford that and know she is reliable . those raised in other means like nannies or foster care are a bit iffy .
3851	oh ok . i think it means one of us have to focus less on career so that we can raise a healthy child	that would be a good idea , since being a good parent is absolutely vital to the child 's development .

3883	that is hard to believe . when you look in the sky and see so many , to know there are even more you can see is wild .	have you looked into the sky and witnessed any constellations , and they were so vivid they look like the only stars in the sky , if so what was its proper name ?

3909	have you ever heard a mash up of barbershop music and rap ? i think jimmy fallon may have done a schtick with this kind of thing ...	i 've never heard that ! i only heard barbershop vocal harmony by itself
3910	there 's definitely a novelty hearing what sounds like very old fashioned vocal harmony and styling , but with rap lyrics . can you think of the last time you heard any kind of barbershop ? or where ?	i do n't remember listening to any barbershop lately but i do listen to the beach boys , my favorite rock band
3911	hey maybe you 're on to something ! a beach boys barbershop quartet ! seriously , some of their songs would lend themselves to the style . ( but i 'm sure you 're thinking ... why ? ! )	well it makes sense ! they are distinguished by their vocal harmonies and early surf songs

3923	he is definitely a controversial individual , but he is pretty unique . unique can be a good thing . i 'm pretty satisfied thus far with him .	he has been controversial from long before the election .
3924	oh yeah definitely has been . despite that , he was probably more liked prior to his run . what president does n't have baggage though right ?	you are very right . the fact that he ran the family estate at such a young age says a lot about him .
3925	i agree completely , although people just want to bring up his failures like trump university , but he 's succeeded in a lot of other areas in business .	he even controlled the miss usa pagents
3926	i have two dogs and a cat as pets . do you have any ?	i do ! i used to have a dog , but now i have a cat . some people have some crazy pets like pigs , gerbils , hamsters or parrots !
3927	i always wanted an african grey parrot ! they have the cutest voices .	yes they do ! pets are so great ! i use mine for company and entertainment , but some can also be used for protection ! i 'd love to have a guard dog !
3928	mine bark a lot when people knock on my door but they 're small so they do n't do much protecting lol . they 're daschunds .	but maybe they 'd scare away a would be intruder ! i think pets are so beneficial for the elderly too . it 's nice for them to have companionship when they lack adequate social interaction with other people .

3937	oh wow , that 's very interesting . i did n't know that was possible . what are some easy roses to grow for beginners like me ?	well since rose plants can range in different sizes , id say miniature roses are the easiest , i know that some rose plants can reach seven meters in height and those would be too hard for a beginner . .
3938	yeah , that sounds like a good choice , especially since i live in an apartment with a small balcony . would roses grow well in humid climates ?	well i know that there are over a hundred species that do really well in humid climates so id say yes .
3940	sometimes , but i grew up with professional musicians so i 'm a bit critical of mine . what do you sing ?	i like different styles and types of music . i like to rap in the shower sometimes . ha !
3941	hah , i 'm not confident enough to try that , unless it 's one of the few comedy raps i know . i 'm more of a rock alternative person .	there are many vocal techniques that can be used ranging from singing to rapping . i also like rock music . do you like classic rock or newer stuff ?

3948	wow , that is very antique i bet you really love that car , could you tell me more about chevrolet	i do love it ! it was the top model in the chevy ii lineup through 1968 !
3949	well i drive a 2010 chevrolet and it has worked beautifully in the past couple of years i really love it	nice ! and it 's great that chevrolet is an american automobile division of the american manufacturer general motors
3950	wow , i never knew that , that is amazing for the us economy i suppose	yes , it is the economy of the united states is a highly developed mixed economy , and chevrolet is a part of that !
3951	i think this will be my preffered brand for the rest of my days haha	nothing wrong with that ! chevrolet vehicles are sold in most automotive markets worldwide , so you would n't have much trouble finding them !
3953	haha ! sounds like it ! i love birdwatching ! which bird call are you best at ?	i can do a mean cuckoo clock , nobody even knows who invented them or where they were made . so mysterious !
3954	i do love a good mystery ! does a convincing bird call serve a purpose ? is it good for hunting ?	sometimes when i do cuckoo clock sounds i lure in animals from the black forest of germany since that 's the cuckoo 's real home

3958	can you imagine exemption from death ? i 'm not so sure about that haha !	true . some experts claim human immortality may be achievable in the first few decades of the 21st century .
3959	i wonder about growing old at a normal rate and staying that way forever !	he absence of aging would provide humans with biological immortality , but not invulnerability to death
3960	ah , so meaning you will n't die of old age , but you can still die form other circumstances ?	yes , disease or physical trauma although mind uploading could solve that issue if it proved possible .
3961	mind uploading ?	the hypothetical futuristic process of scanning mental state ( including long term memory and " self " ) of a particular brain substrate and copying it to a computer .
3962	pink is my girlfriends favorite colors but i dont like it much	i am like your girlfriend . i love pink which is the color most often associated with politeness , charm , tenderness and femininity .

3980	good job ! you should ! what field are you hoping to get into one day ?	hoping to get a masters for my bachelor 's in psychology , but i could also rtry for another sgree entirely and get a masters in that . maybe political science .
3981	that 's a great choice either way . i 'm hoping to be a psychologist .	psychology is a surprisingly flexible master 's degree to have . you can even get hired at prestitigous tech firms " through the side door " as they say .
3982	what does that term mean ?	silicon valley jobs prize technological skills and know how , but becoming a psychgologist for , say google , can get you a silicon valley grade high paying job without intense computer skills .

3984	i had a good friend in college who wanted topublish music and one time i had a chance to sing one of the songs he had written . but just with him listening .	wow . you must be pretty good . do you sing a lot as a hoppy or are you interested in it as a profession ?
3985	well , at least i had choir experience , but i have never had lessons , so i am just as likely to be on key with the car radio as i am to be off key . i only really sing now for myself . it 's fun , but i do n't want to be a performer . i do n't think i would enjoy that .	that 's how i feel , but at least you 've had some great experience . do you ever sing karaoke ?
3986	actually , i have , but ony once . it was fun . a group of us went put after work and we all sang several songs , some solo and some with a group . have you ever taken lessons , earlier it sounded like you knew it would take practice and instruction . it sounded like maybe you had studied	no , i 've had no training but always wanted to . i know that when practice is done on a regular basis , the voice can become more clear and strong . i guess i wish i had pursued this ideas sooner .

3996	does that include weights ? i used to do it as a kid but now i do n't remember how	no its mostly about stretching exercise like yoga or pilates . little to no weights involved .
3997	oh that 's cool then ! is it mostly popular with women ?	no , everyone does it , since it helps with physical , mental , and spiritual practices . i would recommend you try it !
3999	not reallt but i love to watch	i love watching competitions which are primarily based on human , physical competition as well . let me guess bruce jenner is your favorite athlete ?
4000	o you know it !	i 'm more into extreme sports my self . like surfing and mountain climbing .

4004	so what do you think a religion is ? i think its a way of life .	i would say a good definition is a cultural system of designated behaviors and practices .
4005	yes that makes sense . there are many kinds of religions , right ?	oh yeah there are tons . different religions may or may not contain elements that are similar to one another .

4010	i never know how to feel about wikipedia . i think it seems mostly accurate but i know many people question it 's reliability .	a study in the journal " nature " said that in 2005 , wikipedia 's scientific articles came close to the level of accuracy in " encyclop dia britannica
4012	how long have you been doing this ?	long time and a person who sings is called a singer or vacalist
4013	thats awesome .. is it a hobby or a career ?	just a hobby really singers perform songs
4014	oh ok .. that sounds interesting .. you met anyone famous ?	no but a lot of singers perform with a bend of musicians
4015	that sounds reasonable	some singers perform as soloist which means by themselves
4016	i never liked country music , especially growing up in texas ! i 've grown to like it due to my coworkers and how they said that it fills them up with childhood memories though ! what kind of music do you like ?	i kind of like country music , now and then . i really like to listen to blues and country actually takes its roots from folk and blues , so maybe that 's why i like it !
4017	i see ! yes , that 'd make a lot of sense . who do you like listening to the most from blues and country ?	i like some of the newer stuff like luke bryan , but you can never go wrong with a little dolly parton ! i really like string instruments , so i like that country music often has bangos , fiddles and guitars ! country is probably pretty popular in texas , right ?
4018	i 'm not sure , i grew up mostly in dallas and austin , so a lot of people from different states but specifically california have moved here . i mostly listened to top charts music growing up .	me too ! even though i grew up in the south , where country music first began in the 1920s . it 's pretty popular down here !
4019	i agree ! i never appreciated country music until i forced myself to listen to it for a month or so because my coworkers kept blasting it on their speaker .	haha ! well , in 2009 , country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute , so i 'm sure your coworkers contributed to that fact !
4020	jess greenber is my favorite !	i love her work too ! i can n't believe that she 's been making youtube videos since 2010 when she was only 15 !
4021	very interesting i had no idea its been that long ! is there anything else you can tell me about her	i 'm not sure if you know this , but she won " totally covered summer " , a contest by ryan seacrest in 2013 . did you catch that performance ?
4022	yeah i believe i did see that one ! it was a very good performance from what i remember	i think my personal favorite cover that jess greenberg did was " highway to hell " in august 2013 . that was amazing !
4023	yeah i would have to agree ! anything else i should know ?	i think she was born to be a performer . she wowed audiences in st . tropez with a performance of can n't help falling in love with you at age four ! can you believe that ? !
4024	very interesting i cant believe it !	me neither ! jess credits jimi hendrix as being one of her biggest inspirations , but she 's also a fan of ac dc , gnr and red hot chili peppers . i love her taste . those are all solid influences !
4026	tell me more about florida , have not been there before	it has the longest coastline in the contiguous us .

4033	oh wow that sounds like a lot of work .	yeah ! waiting on tables is part of the service sector and among the most common occupations in the us !
4034	that must mean their are a lot of waiters and waitresses out there !	you will n't believe it but as of may 2008 there were over 2.2 million people employed as servers in the us
4035	smartphones are amazing , do you have one ?	a smartphone today is a handheld personal computer . and yes i have a iphone x .
4036	that 's cool , i use android	smartphones are typically pocket sized , but my iphone is a little bit big lol .
4037	it seems that they have gotten larger to accommodate a larger battery	yeah i just like being able to use all the apps and software on it .
4040	lizards are just cool in general but i havent heard of that one before	have you heard of draco malfoy ?
4041	of course , harry potter series is super popular .	what house do you consider yourself apart of ?
4042	never really thought of it but nothing wrong with classic gryffindor	what house did hermione granger belong too ?
4043	wasnt she also gryffindor ?	im not sure gryffindor had a lot of people , was ron ?
4045	yeah it is pretty great	i love how it offers such a wide variety of user generated videos .
4046	there are certainly a lot of cat videos , what other content interests you	now that you mention it cat videos are my favorite videos to watch . cats have been named the " unofficial mascot of the internet " lol
4047	they are everywhere , in fact i did n't even know youtube had anything other then cat videos for years .	i thought the same thing , i was a huge fan of lolcats back in the day .
4049	oh really ? so older country ?	mostly , but one of my favorite patsy cline songs was written by willie nelson , and he 's still around and awesome !
4050	yeah he is still around , he is a huge advocate for legalized marijuana right ?	he is . i got to see him on 4 20 in new braunfels . it was a great show .
4051	new braunfels ? where is that ?	south central texas off highway 46 .
4052	oh interesting , are you from texas ?	yes , i 've lived here all of my life except for three years when i was in nyc .
4054	i 'm not married . i wonder how the ritual of marriage started ?	im not sure but it does differ from culture to culture and between religions but typically it is an institution in which interpersonal relationships are acknowledged .
4055	interesting ! what else do you know about marriage that is interesting ?	aparently in some cultures arranged marriages still happen as well as polygamy being a norm . not so much where i come from though !
4056	oh wow polygamy ? ! that 's so out there to me .	me too ! ! i could just about deal with one spouse let alone several lol . but yes it is the practice of marrying multiple spouses .
4057	lol must be rough ! arranged marriages sounds as if they could be equally rough .	i imagine so . i am glad i can choose my own partner . though the dating field is hard too , this type of courtship meeting for social activities can be awkward sometimes .
4059	gosh , i 'm not certain . probably more than airplane crashes though .	a lot of people are certainly afraid of shark attacks .
4060	well , i am ! i have been afraid since seeing ' jaws ' .	apparently despite shark attacks being rare lots of people fear them because of jaws and the jersey shore attacks of 1916 .
4061	yes . i agree . how many people were affected by the 1916 attacks ?	four were killed and one injured .
4062	do you like the simpsons ? bart is so funny	i do ! the simpsons was created by matt groening for fox . it is one of my favorite shows !
4063	when was it created ?	the shorts were featured on the tracey ullman show in 1987 . the first season was in 1989 .
4064	wow ! 1987 ! that 's a long time ago !	yes , it was one of fox 's first hit shows ! fox may not be around today if it was not for the simpsons !
4065	i totally agree with you ! i think it 's the best show ever	agreed ! it is the longest running american sitcom and animated program !
4066	really ? i did n't know that	yes , its 29th season started on october 1 , 2017 . in the fall the 30th season will start ! many of the original voice actors still are on the show !
4068	i see , adoption can of animals and humans right ?	yes , animals have rights without liberation they have the right to live a good life like any other animal
4069	i reccently adopted a dog from my local shelter . have you ever adopted ?	did you get your dog from a no kill shelter ? a no kill shelter does not kill healthy animals
4070	yes it was a no kill shelter . my dog has previous behavior problems so the previous owners abandoned him .	thats sad . i 'm glad he was able to get into a great home
4071	thanks . do you have any domesticated animals ?	i do n't have any animals just yet . my schedule is too hectic
4073	i cannot decide if i like coke or pepsi more .	the competition between coke and pepsi is called the cola wars .
4074	i actually did n't know that . interesting	pepsi was first called " brad 's drink " and was invented in new bern , north carolina
4075	so i assume a guy named brad created it ?	actually , the man was named caleb bradham . it was switched to pepsi cola in 1898
4076	so who is brad ?	the brad comes from bradham . he moved from his drug store to a rented warehouse in 19083
4078	how long have you been on the diet ?	almost two years , i lost a bout eighty pounds and ju st trying to k eep it off . those basic sections first cut are what steaks and other subdivisions are cut .
4079	oh thats good , what kinds cuts are your favorite ? what do people on this diet typically eat ?	yeah , primal cut is very different than prime cut , or those of higher quality . mostly low carb foods .
4080	i bet this diet can be very pricey .	i do eat more vegetables , and they can be pricey , i look for things on sale . on meat , the neck and legs are the toughest , where the muscles are used the most . it gets more tender away from hoof and horn .
4081	thats good to know .	cut refers to meat attached to the bones , but can also include organ meat
4083	i love orange . what color is blue made of ?	most blues contain a slight mixture of some green or violet .
4084	i see , i love blue eyes . it reminds me of the sky	i have blue eyes :) an optical effect called tydall scattering explains blue eyes
4085	you 're so lucky ! can you elaborate on the tyndall effect ?	yes ! it 's light scattering by particles in a colloid or else particles in a very fine suspencion
4086	i really like italian cuisine . its very diverse .	it certainly is . each region , but especially between the north and the south , have their own way of cooking . it 's all delicious !
4087	i would really like to go to italy for authentic italian food .	i 've been and it 's amazing . i love how their chefs rely on quality ingredients rather that quantity . the flavors really shine !
4088	im so jealous . is there a main ingredient in italian food ?	well pasta , obviously . italians also make full use of lots of vegetables and fish , and cook mainly with olive oil .
4089	that all sounds fantastic . what kind of dishes should i try out ?	it depends where you go . for example , the naples area specializes in using rural ingredients and seafood . other regions have their own specialties . pizza 's pretty good too !
4090	i love pizza . i bet their tomato sauces are amazing .	it is . tomatoes and other vegetables were introduced to the area in the 18th century . the climate is perfect for growing them .
4091	i used to work as a janitor at an office building . i worked at night so it was quiet and sort of nice .	it 's hard work . some janitors do maintenance and security duties in addition to cleaning .
4092	yeah , i was also told to look for anything out of the ordinary as well .	i know the work can be physically demanding and sometimes pretty dirty too . janitors do n't make enough money !
4093	that is definitely true about the money ! at least is is an honest days work though !	that 's true ! a similar job is being a building superintendent . they do more managerial work .
4094	oh ! i did n't know that is what a building superintendent did ! do you have to have a college degree for that position ?	i doubt it . they make more money than janitors . their median pay was 10.68 an hour in 2010 .
4096	that sounds awesome . i like all dogs , i heard pit bulls and bull dogs are loyal dogs , might get territorial as well . not for everyone but they 're sweet .	yeah it 's unfortunate but it 's all in their bloodline . if they were from a lineage that was born to fight , dog fighting is what they want to do . it 's cruel that people bet against animal violence for fun
4097	i agree , there is nothing more cruel than that , people think it 's somehow fun to make dogs suffer , i hate to see it . i think each owner gets a dog in their own image though as far as character goes .	for sure , some people get them to love them , and others like michael vick one of the best and highest paid quarterbacks , still did n't have enough money so used dog fights for income
4098	making dogs suffer just for money is really cruel , this kind of people has no morals . i have a deer chihuahua so i 'm definitely a dog loving person .	they 're so cute ! i 've never heard of a deer chihuahua but they are named afrer the state of chihuahua in mexico !
4099	yeah deer chihuahuas are closer to original aztec techichi 's which they come from , they 're a bit bigger than the tiny ones that are popular . and yes they come from chihuaheno mountains .	they are the smallest breed of dog too ! i love them because they are natural . people keep breeding these poor dogs unnaturally small and it gives them health issues . chihuahuas are au naturale .
4101	i do like fries . why do they have so many different names ?	i really do n't know honestly . they 're the same thing served hot , soft or crispy and eaten for lunch or dinner . i guess people just gave them different names geographically .
4102	that is interesting . what are the best condiments to eat with fries ? i prefer ketchup	ketchup is always a classic for sure . some more adventurous types will eat them with vinegar , mayonnaise and even other toppings .
4103	i 've dipped them in ice cream before and it was pretty good . when were fries invented ?	i do n't know if anyone knows to be honest . they were always prepared by cutting and peeling the potatoes , but when it started may be lost in history .
4105	i also do enjoy it , ive found a lot of good indie bands on soundcloud . what are some good recommendations of indie artists ?	well , in the 2000s , groups like arcade fire , death cab for cutie , and sonic youth really enjoyed commercial success .
4106	oh cool , i 'll have to check them out some time , was indie music always around or is it a fairly new genre ?	recently . it really started in the uk in the 50s and 60s , when many artists launched independent labels because major labels had too much power .
4107	wow i never knew that , i agree some major labels just own too much music and people are afraid of copyrights and stuff .	yeah , those are definitely major issues . it 's to the point that indie record labels have 66 of all music titles . that exist . anywhere .
4108	wow 66 , thats insane , i had no idea they were that popular , do you know if indie artists play at converts ?	of course , alt rock groups play all over the world all the time . whether that means they 're still technically " indie " is kind of debatable because of that .
4109	my parents met at woodstock , i could n't believe it when they told me .	woodstock is a music and art fair .
4110	yeah , i have seen what it was like on tv , it must have been a good time .	it is normally on a diary farm in the mountains .
4111	that is interesting . how often did they have it ?	every year , from august 15 17 . it is truly great .
4112	i bet it gets pretty crowded there , but i 'm sure the music is awesome .	it was mostly a rainy weeekend during that time .
4113	well i 'm sure people still had fun there . i have never gone myself , just heard about it from time to time .	during the event , 32 acts played and more than almost a half million people would be there .
4114	i 've always wanted to be a debutante !	it is is a girl or young woman of an aristocratic or upper class family who has reached maturity to come out and debut
4115	welp , i do n't have an aristocratic or upper class family , so i guess i 'm out of luck ! at what age do most debutantes have their big , elaborate balls ?	normally 18 , originally , the term meant the woman was old enough to be married
4116	oh , i see ! it seems like debutantes have a lot of history ? is this an old term ?	well oddly enough in australia , d butante balls ( or colloquially " deb balls " ) are usually organised by high schools
4117	oh really ? so , it sounds more commonplace than in the us !	it kinda is in the australian debutante wears a white gown
4118	almost like a bride ! it sounds like a beautiful event ! does each girl get her own deb ball ?	yup ! and everyone must learn to ballroom dance
4119	i love physics , its the most interesting thing in the world for me . do you know anything about physics ?	i just no that physics is the study of matter and motion .
4120	my favorite physicists is stephen hawking , what is yours ?	i do n't have a favorite physicists but stephen hawking is awesome . his work is brilliant especially the theorems on gravitational singularity theorems .
4121	yes his book a brief history of time appeared on the british sunday times best seller list for a record breaking 237 weeks . he is awesome . tesla is also really crazy smart .	very true . the telsa battery is higher than any other electric car .
4122	yes , and the alternating current , what would man kind do without that	i know the human mind is amazing how we come up with these cool things every year .
4123	i really like indie or independent music !	indie music is musicproduced indepedently from maor commercialrecord labels or subsidaries . its a do it yourself approach . i like both indie and commercial music personally
4124	yes i like both as well . do you know of any really famous indie artists ?	i cant think of any right now but independent labels have a long history of promoting developments in popular music . labels suh as sun records king recods and stax are exmaples of this
4125	oh awesome , i 've heard of sun records .	many british produces and artist launch independent labels as outlets for work and artist they like but majority fail and get swallowed up by majors . pretty sad :(
4126	that is unfortunate !	yeah , , and also the term indie is used to describe a genre sometimes like indie pop or indie rock . it may include music not independently produced and most independent artist do not fall into a single defined musical style genre . people make music that have have multiple genres so that makes sense
4128	i 'm quite the weeb myself so i can agree .	anime is the japanese term for animation
4129	it 's really broad so saying you do n't like it usually makes zero sense .	many westerners see anime as only japanese
4130	i 've never understood that , since it comes from so many different places .	well strictly it should only be japanese to be an anime
4132	wow . my friend in college was a vegan . so , vegan diets consist of what ?	" dietary vegans " avoid eating animal products , not only meat but also eggs , dairy and other animal derived products .
4133	how do you get protein in your diet ?	protein can usually be obtained by protein supplements or by eating protein heavy foods such as tofu . a well thought out vegan diet can reduce the risk of types of chronic diseases which is always a great thing .
4134	oh okay . did you become a vegan to combat some sort of illness ? my friend became vegan to reduce blood pressure .	i am actually a vegan for ethical reasons as i oppose the use of animals for any purpose . and if it is beneficial to my body then that helps me even more .
4135	ever heard of grateful dead ? i have n't really ,	the grateful dead is an american rock bad
4136	ohh okay , cool ! i love rock music .	grateful dead formed in 1965
4137	that 's so long ago , it sounds like one of those recent band names .	they formed in palo alto california
4138	that 's interesting , it seems like a lot of bands come from there .	yep the grateful dead are quite a big rock band
4140	please tell me more about george r r martin	you will be surprised to know that he wrote the popular a game of thrones " , in 1991 and had it published in 1996 .
4141	what other publications has he	this one is interesting . " a dance with dragons " , took martin six years to write .
4142	wow he is a hero	like the say , the main character always wins . so that will always be the hero . also martin is still writing the sixth novel , " the winds of winter " .
4143	interesting is like he is your fan you are really following him	yes i am a big fan of his . i am currently looking at " a song of ice and fire "
4145	yellow is a beautiful color and it reminds me of the sun	sunlight has a slight yellowish hue because of the temperature of the sun !
4146	i noticed yellow paint on my house fades easier than other colors due to the sunlight , it fades it	yeah it will do that because of the sun 's rays . it is a primary color used in a lot of color printing .
4147	yellow is a pleasant color and uplifts my spirits	happy enough of a color that it was the color associated with the pope .
4149	neat ! i 've never heard that term before ! but i do love cracking open geodes .	it is fun ! it is the recreational study and hobby of collecting rocks
4150	fascinating ! i have a small collection of amethyst and quartz . what types of rocks do you collect ?	i like minerals really , the first amateur geologists were prospectors looking for valuable minerals
4151	interesting ! do you know what time period that occurred ?	well it goes on now , in fact eventually , however , more and more people have been drawn to amateur geology for recreational purposes
4152	wow ! yes , it seems to have become quite popular . i think you can even by hobby rock kits at the craft stores .	recently i have been useing the internet to help find other amateur geologists
4154	yes i hope to own one someday .	those cars are so beautiful ! the company was founded in 1916
4155	cool , where was it founded ?	its headquarters in munich , bavaria

4159	yea its super nice to just smoke a bowl and chill and eat food	exactly ! i really like getting high stoned especially when it works up an appetite and gives you the munchies .
4160	yep , just so fun to laugh and chill with .	i prefer smoking overall since eating it can make the effects take anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes .
4161	yea i like getting a good 2 hour high from it	the edibles last longer though , anywhere from two to even six hours .
4163	i personally do n't think religion was ever supposed to be . i 'm no scholar though . i believe in being spiritual . what else you know on it ?	china is home to some of the oldest religious philosophies . buddhism being one .
4164	you know , i think i did hear that , pretty sure i did anyway . you know much else on it , this makes for a lively discussion	i know that china adheres to three religions , confuscianism and taoism being the other two .
4165	now , no clue they had this many . are n't they an angry country ? that says all the religions in the world do n't make happy . or maybe i just believe what i believe	i am not religious myself , they call me an athiest .
4166	i call me a christian . it 's good talking to you though , you are giving me massive amazing info . so curious about other people	i took a science and religion course that bolstered discussion about bibllical events in a scientific manner .
4168	oh , i 've never really listened to them . what 's one of their songs ?	system of a down is a heavy metal band with songs like toxicity
4169	oh , is it good ?	yea system of a down is a great band
4170	which one is your favorite song by them ?	system of a down has a lot of good songs but i really like arials , great song from a cali bad
4171	oh , they 're from california ? interesting ! when did they become a band ?	system of a down formed in 1994
4173	i have not seen it but i have always wanted to . it 's a classic i hear about so much . what do you like about the movie ?	i guess the actors . scarlet played by vivien leigh and clark gable who played rhett butler .
4174	i am fascinated by old hollywood . the stars of that time are so different yet so similar to the stars today . it really was a different time .	yeah . that film was produced by david o . selznick and directed by victor fleming . they made some good movies then .
4175	everything was still so new at the time . after so many decades , they are running out of ideas .	can only remake something so many times . i liked ingrid bergman also
4176	i must admit i like watching old tv shows more than old movies . especially the old game shows .	yeah , i remember the old laugh track for recorded comedies
4178	i have heard of them , i know that they are form baltimore , maryland , are you a big fan ?	yes i am . they compete in the major league baseball as a member of the east division .
4179	interesting , i have heard that they played in cuba , havana in 1999 , a first game since 1959 they played against cuban national team and won !	oh wow ! i recently found out the team 's current majority owner is a lawyer . had no idea .
4180	we both know some nice facts :d , i know that the orioles ' home uniform is white with the word " orioles " written across the chest .	i 've always liked their uniforms !
4181	me too , the orioles experienced their greatest success from 1966 to 1983 , when they made six world series appearances , my brother just told me that :d	a great team for sure ! that is impressive !
4182	dating is a good thing	dating is a stage of romantic relationships in humans whereby two people meet socially with the aim of each assessing the other 's suitability
4183	that is true . it been long i dated after my girlfriend left me	sorry ! it could also be a form of courtship , consisting of social activities done by the couple ,
4184	that is true . are you presently dating ?	i 'll rather say marriage , which is a marriage , also called matrimony or wedlock , is a socially or ritually recognised union between spouses that establishes rights and obligations between those spouses .
4185	you are right .	also , people can date via telephone or computer or meet in person .
4186	my first car was a ford ranger ! have you ever owned a ford ?	i have no , but i have always liked henry ford .
4187	what was henry ford known for ?	he was the founder of ford in 1903 .
4188	i did n't know fords were that old ! what was their first car ?	i believe it was the model t
4189	those looked like little wagons , right ? how many were produced ?	i am not sure , but they did create fordism , which was a large way of making cars .
4190	i have never heard of fordism . was this the process that revolutionized the car industry ?	it was a way for engineered manufacturing to work fast for making cars .
4192	oh really ? thats cool though i dont think you need that much of the info to send the message	it 's a field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design , but sometimes the term " graphic design " is used synonymously .
4194	oh dang thats awesome .	common uses of graphic design include corporate design ( logos and branding ) , editorial design ( magazines , newspapers and books ) , wayfinding or environmental design , also web design
4195	coffee is very important to me . i drink it every day .	me too . it comes from roasted coffee plant beans .
4196	i always drink my coffee black .	a lot of people like it served hot . some like it cold .
4197	i always drink my coffee hot .	do you drink it for energy ? it has a stimulating effect because of caffiene .
4198	i drink it for energy . it helps me wake up .	same . i love that i can prepare it in a variety of ways .
4200	unicycles can be pretty fun . have you ever seen tricks done on them ?	yes , i have . however i find that unicycles lack stability without a rider .
4201	i bet it would be more difficult to ride a unicycle as a larger person , both in height and weight .	that is true . have you seen the new sport unicycle hockey ? it sounds interesting
4202	i have n't seen any sports involving unicycles . what would your dream unicycle involve ?	i 'm interested in tweaking mine if i had one . like off road or mountain unicycling lol .
4203	that actually sounds very interesting . are there any off roading unicycle races ?	i am sure there are . it 's an extreme sport that was developed in the 1980s .
4205	horses are very cool .	agreed ! they belong to the taxonomic family of equidae .
4206	oh wow i didnt know that .	they have also evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years .
4207	dang that is so long , weve used them for a while ourselves	i know ! they are from a small multi toed creature called the " eohippus " .
4208	so many weird names	i know haha . we began to domesticate them back in 4000 bc .
4210	oh yeah ? i dont know much about them . where do skunks typically live ?	in 1630s they were found often in the new england area
4211	i see ! what do skunks like to eat ?	skunks like to eat leafy greens and are known for there ability to spray disgusting liquid
4212	interesting i thought they ate trash scraps . what animal kills or hunts skunks the most ?	skunks get hunted by other small mammals like foxes
4214	yea i used to . i preferred his previous show . he seems really fake now with the tonight show .	you mean you preferred the one with conan from late night with conan o'brien ?
4215	sort of i guess . before jimmy hosted the tonight show he had late night with jimmy fallon . conan o'brien has had his own show for some time now .	oh , i never watched either of fallon 's shows , i did n't realize he had a show after the tonight show .
4216	it was before the tonight show ! but i simply do n't like him because he fake laughs with every guest and just does not seem genuine .	i can n't believe he 's already been host for four years , since 2014 .
4217	yea it has been a pretty long time . i remember watching the first episode with will smith .	is steven higgins , his sidekick , funny ?
4218	hello , i just wanted to say first that i grew up in an orphanage and it was not fun . do you have any opinions on that ? my name is kevin by the way .	good morning . i do know orphanges have been closed mostly in europe and north america .
4219	really ? i wonder why . do you think its because of money issues or other issues ?	i imagine because it is a state funded program in countries abroad .
4220	wow . after all these years i honestly didnt realize it was funded by the state . i wonder if in europe they are also funded by the state . i spent my childhood in one .	abroad there are a charities that continue to fund orphanages however some are funded by smaller charities and religious groups
4221	thats neat . glad that there are people out there who really care about the children enough to keep them open with charities . i always donate money to a charity every year and i ensure that my money goes to one that does stuff i believe in . if i could find a charity that supports orphanages i will definitely donate to it .	statistics day that kids who live in orphanages are not truly orphans because they have at least one living parent or extended family members .
4223	i like the no kill shelters . all animals deserve a chance . i 'm an animal lover .	well the unfortunate thing in europe 30 countries except four were surveyed and found they permitted the killing of healthy stray dogs . :(
4224	oh that 's terrible . they should make some kind of incentive for spaying and neutering . do you know much else about animal shelters ?	there is actually no government run organization that provides oversight or regulation of shelters on a national basis in the us . so basically these shelters are unregulated for the most part :
4225	i did n't know that . i feel like there definitely should be some sort of laws or at least monitoring . the government is in everything else .	well some positive news many states do regulate shelters within their jurisdiction so while theres no national oversight some states try to do their part when if they can !
4226	i love being part of the humane society and donating my time to animals in need .	i agree ! i am highly against factory farming , the fur trade , puppy mills , wildlife abuse and animal fighting . those are all important issues the humane society advocates against .
4227	it 's a shame that puppy mills are still a thing and people willingly buy their puppies from them . i wish they would all be shut down .	i agree . puppy mills are horrible . they value profit over the welfare of the animals . sometimes im so saddened by what humans will do for profit .
4228	greed is rampant in this day and age . i feel so sorry for the conditions of the female dogs of the mills , being bred over and over again .	yes , and they often develop mammary tumors from repeatedly having babies without care being given to the mothers . so sad !
4229	poor things , i wish i could take all of them in . they probably never see medical care at all .	i agree , and they often have genetic disorders which cause them to live short lives due to their inbreeding . this not only hurts the dog but breaks the hearts of the people who own them .
4230	the owners probably have no idea they are in for that sort of heartache either .	i agree . its truly sad all around
4231	i 'm thinking about buying a ford truck ! they seem really nice , but i do n't know all that much about them .	oh , cool ! ford is an american auto maker . they 're headquartered out of detroit , michigan .
4232	are they really ? how long have they been producing cars ?	the company was founded on june 16 , 1903 , by henry ford .
4233	over 100 years ! that 's incredible ! what are their most popular cars ?	they have many commercial vehicles ! all their luxury cars are sold under the lincoln brand .
4234	ooooh ! lincolns are beautiful cars ! what else can you tell me about the ford motor company ?	ford owns an 8 stake in aston martin of the uk . those are nice cars too ! they also own 49 of jiangling of china .
4235	have you ever been to a parisian cafe	i 've been to a parisian department store ! but no , never a parisian cafe . probably because i 've not been to paris .
4236	i always seem to daydream that i am in a parisian cafe . would you ever like to go to paris ?	i expect i will whether i like it or not . i think i have a business trip coming up to the ' paris region ' and maybe within the city of paris itself .
4237	what do you do for business that will take you to the region of paris ?	well most of the enterprises i 'd visit in paris engage in commerce , but i 'm actually in the aerospace business .
4238	oh i am fascinated by aerospace technology . are you in parts and manufacturing ?	i 'm in aerospace engineering for a company that designs certain parts and systems for aircraft and spacecraft .
4240	yes very much so . i love older artists like ray charles and billie holiday .	oh yeah i love billie holiday . she had no formal music training but her vocal delivery made up for it .
4241	i 've been getting into the strokes as of late . do you like them ?	i used to listen to the strokes a lot back in high school . their debut album was added to rolling stones 500 greatest albums of all time at number 199 .
4242	" is this it ? " is my favorite . im not surprised .	yeah the album was different for the era . they really tried to capture a simpler rock song that wasnt changed a lot in production .
4243	going mountaineering for a breath of fresh air .	yes , it 's a sport where you climb the mountains and breath really fresh air
4244	it can also be done indoors	it has broad definitions and alot of activities can be accorded to it , some scholars identify mountaineering related activities as climbing ( rock and ice ) and trekking up mountains , others are also adding backpacking , hiking , skiing etc
4245	yes , that 's correct . its best for physically agile people .	for most scholars it is climbing and trekking . unless maybe indoor climbing and trekking as you are saying
4246	most take safety precautions to prevent accidents .	hiking can also be a form of mountaineering as it involves rock climbing and it 's likes
4247	interesting . one can do both hiking and climbing .	yes that is because you will go through what athletes go through and you will need technical knowledge so as to be safe
4249	oh i like that song . when did it come out ?	it was released in may , 1997 , and was the bands third single .
4250	oh cool . i do n't think i know any of their other music .	honestly , this is their only good single , and it was written after one of the band members saw an exhibit in denver that featured a bunch of barbie dolls .
4251	thats so cool , i never knew that .	yeah , it still remains their biggest single to date .
4252	do you have any idea if it was certified gold or platnum ?	no , but it 's their only hit to come within the top 20 of the " billboard " hot 100 .
4253	do you know anything about the vancouver grizzlies ?	the grizzlies were a professional canadian basketball team .
4254	i did not even realize that canada had professional basketball teams !	well there used to be a vancouver grizzlies , now they are in the us and known as the memphis grizzlies .
4255	wow , that is interesting ! so they moved from canada to the us ?	correct they moved . there is still a canadian basketball team though . called the toronto raptors .
4256	i think i may have actually heard of that one before . do they ever have any stars that i may have heard of ?	they used to have chris bosh , who i have seen play live . when he was on the miami heat .
4258	i 've never heard of it . what 's it about ?	it is where they get people to live in a house and they do competitons .. there have been 387 total seaons of big brother in over 54 countries
4259	wow ! that is ton of seasons . where was the show first produced ?	the show originally started in the netherlands in the 1990s
4260	that 's unexpected ! so what language do they shoot the show in ?	well it is taped in whatever language the country the show is being aired in . as mentioned earlier it is in 54 different countries
4261	ok , that makes sense . is it only aired on cbs or can it be seen on other channels ?	cbs in america where it airs
4262	i love fairy tales , do you enjoy them too ?	not so much , i rather prefer fictions . fairy tale is a type of short story that typically features folkloric fantasy characters .
4263	what kind of fiction works do you enjoy ? any particular author ?	science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific discovery
4264	science fiction is great , i really like isaac asimov .	isaac asimov ( born isaak ozimov was an american writer and professor of biochemistry at boston
4265	do you have a favorite work of his ? i like all his works really .	his books includes , the early asimov " ( 1972 ) , " before the golden age " ( 1974 ) , and " buy jupiter and other stories " ( 1975 )
4266	last night i had a great 6 oz sirloin steak from texas roadhouse . it was pretty good . are you a steak eater yourself ?	i love steak whether it be grilled , broiled , or stir fried ! i 've never eaten at the texan roadhouse before . i 'm happy to hear you had a nice steak there !
4267	yes . which type your favorite ? grilled ? broiled ? i know there are so many ways to cook them and so many types .	i prefer a grilled steak that has been marinated and served with a big baked potato ! lol
4268	the baked potato is almost a staple with steaks . although for me , i prefer a fried potato . fried potatoes , just slightly burnt are great . i also like my steak cooked medium to medium well . i like it a little pink .	oh i adore french fries ! i love them crispy and could basically eat them by themselves as a snack ! i also love my steak medium slightly pink .
4269	i prefer the " steak " fries . a bit larger than french fries . the thing i have come to find about most fast food restaurants is that they do not cook their french fries long enough . they are too soft and not done enough . when i fry them , or when i go to a restaurant like texas roadhouse , they are cooked just right . crispy , even a little burnt is good with me . what do you think ?	i 'm totally with you ! i love them crispy not mushy ! i love big fat steak fries and now you have made me hungry ! lol
4270	well , what type of steak do you like best ? sirloin ? t bone ?	i also love a good sirloin and i understand it is quite popular and prized among steaks .
4272	yes but i do n't really understand it , what can you tell me about it ?	it would be the absense of aging , but some say it may not mean your immune to disease or physical trauma .
4273	so its like eternal life but no aging ?	yes , exactly . some say it happen to an extent in the not to distant future .
4274	i 've often heard in church that immortality is often stated to be one of the promises of god .	that 's a very different type of thing , christian views are different .
4275	i work at amazon ! its such an amazing place to work for , i 'm very lucky . do you like the company ?	not really . they are putting all mom and pops out of business . i have not liked them since 1994 when jeff bezos started .
4276	i can understand that ! i 'm sorry if you or someone you know has been affected . do you know how much the giant company is worth ?	a fair amount . keep your friends close and your enemy 's closer . i know they are based in seattle , washington and started off as a book store .
4277	its a shame that large companies like amazon feel the need to conquer the market even though they probably had enough money before . people are very greedy . do you know what we sell at amazon ?	you sell everything . you work for the largest internet retailer in the world and second largest after alibaba group in terms of total sales .
4278	ah i 've heard of alibaba , they are the biggest in china , i think . so amazon are doing extremely well . it truly is a shame that they have taken over the market . what else can you tell me about amazon ?	the company makes it 's own electronics like the kindle . it 's like a broke man 's apple . have you tried on any of the clothing they make ?
4280	im not to fond of shrimp	i 've only tasted one once on accident , because i did n't know that a prawn was the same thing as a shrimp when i visited the united kingdom .
4281	my daughter is also allergic to shrimp . the last time she accidentally ate one , she was hospitalized	i was hospitalized as well . i had a lot of swelling and shortness of breath , not to mention a very itchy full body rash .
4282	i wonder why so many people are allergic to shrimp	i do n't know the exact reason for the number of people , just that the cause is a hypersensitivity of the immune system .
4284	oh i love pasta ! do you make your own spaghetti and sauce ?	i do and italian writers often make fun of the dish calling it pseudo italian or non italian
4285	well , i consider it italian . if they do n't , why not ? how can it not be italian ?	meatballs in italy are only served with egg based pasta so the writers made fun of it
4286	i like egg noodles , too , but i did n't realize there was such discernment ! how do you make your meatballs ?	i mix ground beef and pork with egg , onion , bell pepper and bake y meatballs
4288	oh wow does the visual impairment have a name ?	i guess you could call it blindness which means there is a near or total complete vision loss .
4289	man that sounds like it would make life more difficult . does he use a cane or a service dog ?	yes he does ! the dog has a great temperament and psychological makeup . he 's great !
4290	that 's amazing ! what type of specialized training did he have to go through to become a service dog ?	some service dogs are bred by trainers and others are trained by specialized organizations .
4291	i been feeling the weight of the years lately , i am getting older and it makes me sad .	yes , same here . it is tough dealing with the aging process and slower reaction times . our knowledge does continue to grow !
4292	yeah that is a positive point , besides we get wiser as time goes by .	yes , hopefully scientists can figure out why two thirds of humans die from age related causes .
4293	who knows , maybe we can benefit from that research before its too late	that 's true . so perhaps scientists will figure out how to reverse the process of becoming older and regenerate cells faster .
4294	do you know if this research is on advanced stages ?	every species has the ability to regenerate cells , but not sure how advanced scientists are on humans rather than other animals or bacteria at this point .
4295	well im sure many advancements will be made in the future .	yes , hopefully there will be cures for those diseases like parkinson 's disease or dementia . perhaps cell regeneration will be a part of that research .
4296	when i was a child my parents separated . it was the worst feeling in the world .	oh , yes divorce is so sad , the dissolution of marriage and termination of marital union just makes me cry .
4297	how long do you think it takes to really get over something like that	oh , it depends on the person , some people can never really get over it . especially if the reasons for the divorce were mutual or if someone was n't sexually faithful !
4298	how many people do you think cheat on their spouses in a given year ? i bet it is a lot .	oh , i have no clue , probably a lot like you said ! but if they were n't cheating than the couple could file for an annulment , which declares the marriage as null , instead of a divorce
4299	what are the ramifications of an annullment ?	well , unlike divorce , an annulment is basically making it say that your marriage never happened , while a divorce says it happened and did n't work
4300	there are a lot of people who practice vegetarianism , but i do n't think i ever could . i love meat to much .	some people may start vegetarianism for different reasons , but i am on the same boat . i love me some meat .
4301	have you ever known anyone who started vegetarianism ?	i had an ex who tried vegetarianism , she wanted me to abstain from all meat products , but i could n't as i do n't even like salads .
4302	lol , i like salads , but i want to have meat in them . steak , chicken , ham , bacon ... man i 'm making myself hungry .	if i made a salad it would be 90 percent bacon bits cheese and dressing . god bless that salt cured pork topping .
4303	yes , i do n't understand how someone will n't eat bacon . i know some people turn to vegetarianism for health reasons .	i know a friend who turned vegetarian for that very reason . she had health issues with a lot of proteins making her sick .
4305	oh no , morning sickness can strike at any time .	it 's not something i know much about but i can relate to nausea caused by anxiety or disgust .
4306	me either , but anxiety strikes me a lot when i 'm at work . it 's terrible when you end up having panic attacks due to it .	social anxiety can cause sweating , trembling , and a few others . not cool but very real .
4307	it can sometimes cause you to black out as well . i 've gotten in a few car accidents due to my anxiety .	thank goodness for seat belts . without them the likelihood of death rises quickly .
4309	i love the smell of rain , rain is great !	i love sweet water too , have you tried it ?
4310	i am not familiar with sweet water . what is that ?	you 've never heard of sweet water incorporated ? in 2009 it broke ground in it 's facility .
4311	what does sweet water produce ?	it provides fresh , safe food the communities while minimizing it 's impact on the environment . i totally support sweet water and all they are
4312	that 's cool . i like that they are environmentally socially responsible .	i support them while drinking a fresh bottle of recycled rain water lol it 's a good life
4314	some might call it something other than a trait .	like what ? i just strive for flawlessness and i set high performance standarts
4315	i believe there are maladaptive forms , where people try to achieve unattainable or unrealistic goals .	maybe so . in the end , we derive pleasure from reaching our goals
4316	pressuring oneself to achieve unrealistic goals sets a person up for disappointment . they tend to be harshly critical of themselves.when they fail	unless we do n't fail ) but the truth is when we do n't reach our goals we can easily fall into depression
4317	true , those who strive for excellence but can use mistakes as an incentive to work harder .	but noraml perfectionists are more inclined to pursue perfection without compromising self esteem
4319	i am not sure i would want to be immortal .	it would surprise you to know that some modern species may have biological immortality .
4320	what species would that be ?	well , research is on going , when results are final you will hear but these results will take away the absence of aging would provide humans with biological immortality
4321	when is this supposed to happen ?	100 years from now . major point of focus of religion , as well as the subject of speculation , fantasy , and debate
4322	that is very interesting . what else can you tell me about it ?	in religious contexts , immortality is often stated to be one of the promises of god
4324	yes i remember seeing it a long time ago . when was it made ?	it was released to theaters on november 17 , 1989 and made 84 million during the initial release
4325	i see . and do you know how many sales it made in box office ?	it has made 211 million is total lifetime gross worldwide
4326	that is a lot of money . what else do you know about this movie	it also marked the start of the era known as the disney renaissance period
4327	i can see why , it was a really good movie . i like it more than frozen !	yes ! even though frozen had better 3d computer animated graphics , i still love the story line for the little mermaid
4329	what do you mean exactly ?	reading is about decoding symbols in order to construct and derive meaning , this is also known as reading comprehension .
4330	oh ok yea its pretty interesting that our brains can do that	right , in addition its really thrilling because reading requires creativity and critical analysis .
4331	yea i definitely agree	when you consume literature you have to venture into each new piece and inately derive from the literal world complex images that make sense in new and unfamiliar text .
4332	yea i see what you mean	there are no concrete laws while reading , it allows you and each individual an opportunity to escape and produce their own introspection .
4333	i love to eat vegetarian	why do you want to abstain from the consumption of red meat , poultry , seafood , and the flesh of any other animal
4334	no i dont like that i like vegetable like potato , cabbage , carrot etc	carrot among other vegetables are good for the health as well . just eat the taproot and sometimes the greens are sometimes eaten as well .
4335	good , i like food . my favourite is idly and sambar . idly is world famous food .	do you mean idli , the savoury rice cake . it is often taken as a breakfast foods throughout india and neighbouring countries like sri lanka .
4336	yes it is good for digestion . good food for babies	which other indian cuisine do you like . we have a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the indian subcontinent .
4337	yes most famous is idly , dosai , pongal , puri . these are tiffin items .	the only thing i do not like about their food is that it is heavily influenced by religion , in particular hindu
4338	do you like science fiction ?	hello ! my favorite science fiction stories are about space travel .
4339	me too ! ! its so interesting . any movies ?	star trek the next generation movies were some of my favorites since they visit alien worlds . have you watched any of them ?
4340	i have n't watched the movies but i did watch the original series . who was your favorite character ?	captain kirk was my favorite . what about you ?
4341	spock was my favorite .	leonard nimoy did a fantastic job in the role ! i wonder how long it took him to master the vulcan salute ?
4342	true the vulcan salute was so interesting .	what 's more , leonard nimoy actually came up with it .
4343	do you have red hair ? i do n't have it naturally , but my hair is dyed red .	no i do n't have red hair . i would love to have it though . it 's so rare and unique only 1 2 of every human !
4344	that 's so cool ! i did n't know it was so rare . it makes me feel even more special to have red hair .	i 'm asian , so my hair color is always going to be black or brown .
4345	you could always bleach it and then color the bleached hair red .	no , i think the only time i will try to dye my hair is when it 's gray . i think it damages my hair when i do .
4346	if you use something called olaplex , you could have red hair in no time with very little damage .	interesting ... have you ever used henna to dye your hair ?
4347	no i have n't , but i heard that is a much healthier alternative . they have some lovely red shades too .	i 've used henna for temporary body art but never hair coloring . will have to try next time .
4348	my mom used to read me fairy tales every night before bed .	i always loved being told fairy tales , my favorites involved eleven , trolls and dragons .
4349	oh yeah ! i loved a good story with a prince and a princess .	fairy tales were often used to describe a happy ending to the story or a fairy tale romance .
4350	cool ! i love how magical i always thought they were as a child .	the brothers grimm were some of the best story tellers of their time and are responsible for most stories we know today like cinderella , snowwhite and sleeping beauty
4351	i have heard of them before ! my favorite fairy tail was always cinderella .	there are actually many different versions of the cinderella story from different countries .
4352	i did n't know that but it makes sense that the story of the underdog getting the prince .	it was originally titled " the glass slipper " and it highlighted the themes of unjust oppression and reward !
4353	what do you think about chicken ?	i love chicken . especially crispy fried chicken !
4354	cool . i love to eat chicken as well . i had a pet chicken as a child though .	so does that mean you do n't eat chicken as a source of food then ?
4355	i do actually ! in fact , the reason i had the pet chicken was because when we moved into the farm house they had removed all the chicken that were there before we lived there . however , this one chicken had hidden behind the chicken coop door . the previous people made a deal with me over the course of a few months that they would give me a kitten if i gave them their chicken . i accepted because i did n't have much of a choice as a child and farm life is different than city life . anyway , they said i had fattened it up well and it was the best chicken they ever ate .	hahaha that is the most bizarre story i 've ever heard . i bet they made chicken and waffles
4356	lol ! i do n't think they knew about chicken and waffles in that part of the world , but maybe ... :)	what part of the world is that ? i 'm from the south and soul food is the best ! can n't imagine being without it .
4357	northern midwest near canada . i love soul food too :) i adore well made greens . what 's your favorite soul food ?	i like greens too ! what city is your favorite soul food from ?
4359	i love starbucks . what is it like to work there ?	it 's great . we do a really nice pumpkin spice latte
4360	my wife likes the pumpkin spice latte . i am more of a cafe macchiato person . is the pumpkin spice a seasonal item ?	the pumpkin spice latte is only available in fall and winter
4361	i thought so . how long has starbucks been around ?	it started in 1971 in seattle :)
4362	wow , that is a long time . is it still head quartered in seattle ?	i 'm not sure , but we have 23,768 locations across the globe !
4364	i do n't know a whole lot about it . i was raised catholic but do n't practice anything now .	it is the worlds largest religion apparently with over 2.4 billion followers or 33 of the population known as christians
4365	interesting . i did n't think christianity was an actual religion .	yeah me either . they believe that jesus is the son of god and the savior of humanity whose coming as the messiah was prophesied in the old testament
4366	is n't that similar to the catholic religion ?	i am not sure . i do n't know much about catholicism . it says that christianity has played a prominent role in shaping of western civilization
4367	i believe that . people really live by those teacings .	apparently christians make up the majority of the population in 158 countries and territories
4369	i love anmials , but i eat meat	do you know of any new foods i can add to my plant based menu ?
4370	i dont know much but probably organic	any good restaurants with vegan beverages ?
4371	i 'm not familiar but you could make your own with a blender	what vegan ingredients could i add ?
4372	do you know a lot about juicing ?	yes i do . are you referring to fresh pressed fruits and veggies ?
4373	yes i am . it is such a great way to get all of your fruit and vegetable servings in .	i agree . it 's often used for dietary reasons and even a form of alternative medicine . so healthy for us !
4374	yes it is . it can be very tasty as well of course .	i like some better than others :) actually films such as fat , sick and nearly dead " and " food matters " helped increased sales of juicers .
4375	wow . i have never heard of any of these films . i wonder when this tred first took off .	well , it first became popular in the 70 ' s , but juicing tools have been used throughout history !
4376	hi ! i 'm a choir singer with the southern baptist convention	cool so you are one of the 15 million members .
4377	yes ! there are a lot of us	its the worlds second largest christian demonination .
4378	yes which is the first ?	the catholic church .
4379	ah ! are you catholic yourself ?	no i am not but it has 1.29 billion members .
4381	wow , i heard its interesting ! tell me about it	it 's about a little mermaid who wants to become a human and willing to give up being a mermaid .
4382	who created the little mermaid ?	it was put out by disney and based on a danish fairy tale by hans christian andersen .
4383	what was the gross sale back then ?	it got 84 million domestically . it 's probably a lot adjusted for inflation .
4384	did it win any awards ?	i 'm not too sure . i would n't be surprised if it did .
4385	i adore brunch . best options for a meal , in my opinion !	hey , i 'm planning a brunch right now ! i 'm serving it tomorrow to my inlaws ! it 's a combination of breakfast and lunch , so i 'll be serving it around 11 am .
4386	i 'll be over . what are you serving ?	finger sandwiches , devilled eggs , and since it 's my inlaws , there will definitely be some form of alcoholic drink ! i 'll need it !
4387	great choices . i can only think of bloody marys as drink options ? i know i am forgetting others .	i do n't care what it is , as long as it 's strong ! haha ! i 'm thinking of making eggs , sausages , and bacon too so if you want some , be here by 11 !
4388	sounds great ! !	awesome ! it 's going to be one of those serve yourself buffets , so grab lots before the inlaws start digging in !
4389	i have a pet pug named corky :) he 's the cutest !	i love pugs , i like them for their fine , glossy coat , they come in a variety of colours , most often fawn or black , and they have a cute square body with lots of muscles .
4390	i love them too ! mine is black . where did the breed originate from ?	if my memory serves me correctly , pugs were actually brought from china to europe in the 16th century and were very popularized in western europe by the house of orange of the netherlands , and the house of stuart .
4391	woah ! i did n't realize they had that much history ... corky must have been royalty ! haha .	indeed they were , i bet they were popular because pugs are well known for being really sociable and gentle companion dogs and they are good around kids .
4392	awww , my corky does have a very gentle temperament . i just love their cute snouts .	speaking of royalty , in the uk , in the 19th century , queen victoria developed a fond passion for pugs which she passed on to other members of her royal family
4393	i 've always wanted to go to iceland . have you ever been ?	i 've never been before . is n't that an island located in europe ? do you plan to go soon ?
4394	no , i 'm afraid to fly . if i could ever get over the fear i would go .	it 's too bad that they can n't build a long bridge to get there for people like you . maybe the fact that the island is volcanic makes that a good idea to not travel there .
4395	yeah probably . i like experiencing new places . see things i 've never seen . as long as i can drive lol	it 's crazy that the first settlement on iceland dates back to 874 . that 's a long time ago ! i wonder what they ate back then .. ?
4396	yes that is a very long time ago . i imagine the things they ate back then were trial and error . probably like , oh this looks good lets see if we can eat it without being poisoned . .	that 's true . being surrounded by water makes me think a lot of seafood . i bet they had some good farming land for when they norwegians first arrived .
4397	yes , i 'd say they ate a lot of fish .	i bet it is a gorgeous countryside over there . their location in the upper hemisphere keeps the summer a bit cooler though . i 'm not sure if i 'd like that .. would you ?
4398	blue is such a nice color	you do n't have to tell me twice i love one of the three primary colors of rgb , blue .
4399	its awesome , i love all the varieties	for sure , blue falls between violet and green both great colors but blue is superior .
4400	blue is great when mixed with either color too	blue contains a mixture itself of other colors . azure contains green . ultramarine contains violet .
4403	i 've never tried it . what toppings do you put on a new york style pizza ?	any toppings you want , really . traditional new york style pizza just has tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese though .
4404	is it only popular in new york , or in other places as well ?	it 's actually popular in a lot of neighboring states , like new jersey and connecticut , but it 's also very popular in other states , including here in florida !
4405	wow , i 'm located in texas , so that 's why i 'm not familiar with it . who invented the new york style pizza ?	i 'm not sure who invented it , but the first pizzeria to ever open in the united states was opened by gennaro lombardi in new york in 1905 .
4406	rita hayworth is my dream woman !	you mean was ? she was an american actress and dancer that died in 1987
4407	yes , i just meant that i want whoever i fall in love with to be just like her . she may be gone but her charm and beauty lives on .	well thats understandable , she achieved fame during the 1940s as one of the era 's top stars , appearing in a total of 61 films over 37 years .
4408	wow thats a lot , do you know which film was considered her best ?	she is best known for her performance in the 1946 film noir , " gilda "
4409	i 'll have to wholeheartedly agree with that , it was an amazing film .	some people called her the love goddess to describe hayworth after she had become the most glamorous screen idol of the 1940s
4410	i 'll agree with that too , she 's definitely a goddess !	her all time greatest success was in the technicolor musical " cover girl "
4411	hi . have you heard of open relationships ? i wish my boyfriend did n't want one .	that is upsetting that he wants ojne and you dont
4412	i agree . i think that if you have one its should be a mutual decision .	yes , it definitely cannot be one sided
4413	how long has the idea of an open relationship been around ?	the idea has been recognized since the 1970s
4414	that makes sense . right after the 60 ' s .	there are actually many types of open relationships
4416	i definitely agree . people jump into getting married , that 's why . you do n't know someone after 6 months , or even a year !	my girlfriend and i have been dating for several years . of course she wants to get married , but i take that commitment very seriously . i 'm trying to make sure everything is in order to set us up for success before i take the plunge .
4417	i think that is a great idea . my boyfriend and i have been living together for 8 years now . i am still learning new things about him daily . we hope to get married someday , but no rush because neither of us want to get divorced .	totally on the same page . divorce laws also scare me . she and i are both working professionals and the thought of the monetary and legal implications of divorce have me treading lightly . it 's just that prenups are n't exactly romantic .
4418	definitely ! i never understood a prenup . i always thought it showed lack of faith that things would work out . you would always have it looming over your head .	agreed . although i 've always thought that a simple prenup with a binding arbitration agreement would be prudent . in other words : if we get divorced , we agree not to take it to court and to settle it between ourselves .
4419	do you like to read ?	yes , i do like to read . it is the process of decoding symbols in order to derive meaning .
4420	that 's right . i was thinking of picking up the second mistborn book and finishing the series .	i have n't read mistborn myself but heard they are fantasy novels written by brandon sanderson .
4421	yeah , he wrote wheel of time too i believe . his first book was awesome .	actually the wheel of time was written by james oliver rigney , using his pen name robert jordan .
4422	oh yeah that 's right . yeah what else has brandon sanderson wrote ?	his best known work is the cosmere universe , which includes " mistborn " and " the stormlight archive " . he did finish jordan 's wheel of time .
4423	i grew up in the south and my grandmother always made fried chicken for sunday lunch . do you like fried chicken ?	heck yea ! i 'm from louisville , so i gotta get down with some kfc ! 2nd biggest fast food chain !
4424	i live about a block from kfc and i love the chicken bowl . lol	double down is the cats pajamas , though . bacon , cheese , and chicken as the " bread ! "
4425	what exactly is the double down ? lol gotta admit ... you have me interested with the bacon , cheese and chicken for bread !	think of a sandwich , where instead of pieces of bread , there are fried chicken filets , and the filler is ooey gooey cheese and bacon .
4426	you sold me ! i am officially hungry ! lol	if that makes you hungry , do n't get me started on my favorite breakfasts . it 's true , the first meal of the day is the best .
4428	were they running around with dinos back then ?	not quite , but that would have been funny ! like flintstones , dinos were mesozoic . this was mesolithic , sounds close though . it falls between paleolithic and neolithic !
4429	yea thats what i was thinking about , the flinstones . what types of fish did they have back then	catfish and tilapia for sure , i hear mullets were even worshiped !
4430	oh that sounds yummy	i 'm sure a diet in fish was good back then , protein for a harder life !
4431	yea , with some alcohol on the side , if they knew how to make it back then !	i 'm sure they did , i think imbibing in spirits has been around forever . just looked different i 'm sure .
4433	divorce is roughest on the kids . i am glad that states have made it easier to get divorced , with many allowing " no fault " dissolutions .	the laws do seem to vary around the world but most countries do require the sanction of the courts to help resolve a lot of the issues that come up .
4434	amazing to think that some places divorce is illegal . i shudder to think what it must be like to be trapped like that .	at least in the us the courts can kinda step in and help figure out all the child custody , support , visitation , property and debt issues .
4435	sometimes it is necessary for the judge to decide those issues when the parents can n't work it out .	and there are so many reasons for divorce , i think one of the biggest can be a personality clash .
4436	i love the sound of a guitar riff coming thru a huge amplifier . wouldnt you agree ?	yeah same . the fretted instrument with six strings sounds nice . it looks very hard . i 'm currently learning piano .
4437	i know how to play a few songs on a guitar . mainly nirvana and metallica . whos your favorite guitarists ?	oh nice . i was actually just listening to nothing else matters by tthe american heavy medal band . i also like nirvanna . i
4438	nothing else matters has some amazing guitar riffs .	yeah it really does . i honestly listen to like almost every genre , but have n't like heavily explored rock enough to be honest . i like the unforgiven and where i may roam and sad but true among others a lot .
4439	the master of puppets is a must listen to if your exploring metallica . i love their gutarists gibson guitar .	ok ok . i think i 've heard it but i 'll give a re listen . it sais its the third studio album from metallica . do you lke other rock besides metal ?
4441	that has got to be tough . my parents are still together so i dont have much experience with divorce .	it 's a dissolution of marriage thereby dissolving the bonds of matrimony . it 's a difficult process !
4442	i have heard that a divorce can take a while . im guessing it has to go through the legal process at court ?	yes , it does need the sanction of a court especially regarding alimony and child custody .
4443	yea i forget about that when i think about divorces .	it can get quite complicated when there 's so many things to settle , like child support , distribution of property , and division of debt .

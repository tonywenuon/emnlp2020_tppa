1690	i knew soccer and cricket was . i never knew they played it over there . is it pretty popular ?	apparently the lithuania men 's national basketball team has made them a serious force of the sport in europe .
1691	interesting . tell me more about them .	lithuania only has a population of 2.9 million but the country is very devoted to basketball .
1692	do they have to go to college to play like in the us ?	i do n't know about that but basketball is the most popular sport in their country .
1693	hey there ! so how do you feel about cats ?	the warriors was written by erin hunter
1694	well that 's interesting but i was wondering about cats lol . do you like cats ?	i love cats . there are more than seventy recognized cat breeds !
1695	oh wow ! i did n't know that . what are the most popular cat breeds among people in the united states ?	i 'm not sure what the most popular is but i do know that cats can see in near darkness which is just great .
1696	that 's great for catching pests lol . what 's your favorite cat fact ?	cats can hear sounds well above the frequency range humans can here . that 's really interesting to me .
1697	me too . did you know cats can make about 100 different sounds ? dogs make only 10	i did n't know that ! cats are great companions though and excellent hunters . do you know any other interesting facts about cats ?
1699	great names ! we 're between pups at the moment we 've always gotten boxers . what breed ( s ) are rocko and bimbo ?	they 're both jack russells . crazy little guys . also , dogs are a member of the ' canis ' genus
1700	i understand those are some high energy pups ! do they get along with one another ? other people ?	oh they get along fine with each other and are generally friendly to people , but they do tend to bark and jump on them . dogs were the first species to be domesticated !
1701	and that must have been waaaaay back . are n't dogs basically descended from wolves ?	yes ! dogs and gray wolves are sisters ( technically speaking ) . the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct now , though .
1702	interesting ... i wonder what the most popular breed of dog is ? i imagine that varies year to year , country to country . though labs must be way up there for the us .	oh yes , ithey do change periodically . dogs vary in shape , size , and color so there are lots of variations . by the way , how friendly are boxers ?
1703	i love watching and playing basketball .	i do too ! basketball is a sport played on a rectangular court .
1704	its fun to do 2v2 with friends	it definitely is a lot of fun , though sometimes i prefer less limited contact sports .
1705	thats fair , i like basketball because its full of constant action .	that 's a good reason to like it . the objective is to get the ball through the hoop , of course .
1706	oh yea its so simple , i like it for that .	it really is super simple . the hoop is mounted to a backboard which makes it a little easier .
1708	oh no . i am a sugar addict . i take much more sweets compared with normal people	what kind of candies do you normally eat ? caramels ? hard candy ?
1709	caramels.often i chose milk sweets too.the sweets are very useful to remove our stress	do you prefer your caramels to be soft and chewy or hard ? there are so many kinds !
1710	by the way i am not a kid.but i love caramels.my caramels should be so soft and chewy.it leads to give me satisfaction when i ate it	have you heard of squirrel nut caramels ? they 're chocolate flavored , chewy , and have peanuts mixed in . they make them in a factory nearby me .
1711	my favorite dessert is cheescake . do you like cheescake ?	yes ! i love oreo and strawberry cheescake . you ?
1712	i love oreo cheescake too ! i like raspberry lemon , too . do you know how to make it ?	no , but i know it is baked and usually refrigerated haha .
1713	i 've made them before . it 's not too hard . do you have a favorite place to get cheescake ?	yeah ! i love the layer with cream cheese and ricotta , and not particularly .
1714	can n't go wrong with cheescake factory if you have one near you . how often to you eat cheesecake for dessert ?	i 've been there ! not to often , but when i want a sweet dessert !
1715	i love mountain dew , i drink it every day .	i do too ! it 's a carbonated soft drink made by pepsico .
1716	cool , i love the taste of it .	it 's great ! the original formula was invented in 1940 .
1717	that is a while ago , who invented it ?	it was invented by tennessee beverage bottlers barney and ally hartman .
1718	nice . i love tennessee .	i 've never been there before . one thing to note is that the formula was revised in 1958 so we are n't drinking the original .
1720	i used to thoroughly enjoy heavy metal when i was younger during my teenage years ! who are some of the best heavy metal bands ?	well we could go old school and nostalgic with 3 of the biggest baddest : led zepellin , black sabbath , and deep purple ! did you have a favorite ?
1721	i 've heard of all of them except deep purple . black sabbath is the one with ozzy osbourne right ? i can n't remember the band i used to listen to but i had the whole album on repeat ! what else do you know about heavy metal ?	yes to black sabbath and ozzy . like lots of genres , it 's seen its share of offshoots and evolution like the 80s " glam metal " movement with groups like motley crue and poison !
1722	oh wow , i can definitely appreciate the culture of heavy metal ! it was bullet for my valentine ! they were so good back in the day . do you know when heavy metal started ?	late 60s and early 70s , largely in the uk , interestingly . for some reason , it seems very american to me .
1723	that 's interesting , so it came out by the end of the hippy era ? i have a friend in a heavy metal band i do like the music its very different . what else can you tell me about heavy metal ?	interestingly , its roots are in blues rock and psychedelica so right in line with the time it was born . of course it 's got a much bigger , massive sound . and loud !
1725	oh that 's great , what are the figures ?	8,537 , 673 as of 2016 can you imagine that many people in one huge city ?
1726	i bet there must be someone special there that is making so many people come there	new york city is the media , financial , cultural capital of the world influencing so many markets
1727	amazing , apart from business are there any special attractions ?	new york has five counties or bouroughs queens , manhatten , staten island , brooklyn bronx
1728	which of these five counties is the busiest ?	not sure but new york is linguistically diverse because people speak 800 languages there , can you imagine ?
1729	i do n't follow professional basketball much more of a college basketball person myself . how about you ?	i dont follow basketball much , but i a friend of mine is a fan of the vancouver grizzllies .
1730	do they still exist ? i thought they transferred years ago . but what do i know ? !	i know they were established in 1995 along with the toronto raptors as part of nba expansion to canada .
1731	did they ever win anything ? for some reason i never think of canada as a basketball country .	yes they struggled in the early years but they won a total of 101 games but lost 359
1732	that 's a terrible record ! why on earth did your friend support them ? it 's like my husband supporting the miami dolphins , even though they are useless ( he 's from miami ) .	who knows why anyone support these losing teams ? at least the dolphins are floridas oldest professional sports team , i guess that could be a reason to support them .
1733	true enough . it must be soul destroying , losing week after week . what else do you know about the grizzlies ?	i know that following the 2000 01 season they relocated to memphis , tennesse
1735	it is very interesting . i share the same thought about god as you . what do you find most interesting ?	one part that is interesting is that older civilizations used god ( s ) to explain certain natural processes , like the sun rising .
1736	does that come from people needing to explain the unexplained ?	pretty much , unexplained things scare people so they need to explain them to put themselves at ease . especially back then with limited scientific knowledge .
1737	do you know what made people start believing in only one god ?	i believe that much of it is due to the rise of christianity , which is the most popular monotheistic religion ever and still is .
1738	you know a lot about this subject . do you know any other good facts about god ?	well in almost every single religion , god is omniscient , omnipotent , and omnipresent as well .
1739	one of my favorite bands is system of a down . have you ever heard their music ?	yeah , soad is a heavy metal band from california .
1740	i like their fast tempo and clear lyrics . i can always understand what they are singing about .	i have trouble understanding them occasionally . the band achieved success with the release of their five studio albums .
1741	they like to sing about political events and wars . they have had quite a few big hits .	they have a lot of good songs . must be why three of their albums were debuted on the " billboard " 200 .
1742	yeah , i am amazed at how popular they have become throughout the world . i want to see them in concert some time .	i know what you mean ! they 've also nominated for four grammy awards for the song " b . y . o . b " .
1743	i like to swim even when i 'm not very good at it .	i love to swim too . people will swim in different places including fresh water , salt water , they do it for recreation , sport , exercise , or survivall
1744	yes there are some amazing pro swimmers like micheal phelps , do you remember how many gold medals has he won ?	yes micheal phelps won like 23 gold medals !
1745	wow , amazing ! . are you any good at swimming or other sports ?	i enjoy swimming and it is consistently one of the top public recreational activities
1746	yes but i prefer other sports like running where you can look around and enjoy the views and fresh air .	the good thing with swimming versus running is that swimming is " low impact " which is better for people with joint issues
1747	that is true , it is some times used by runners and other athletes while recovering from injuries .	since the human body is only slightly less dense than water , water supports the weight of the body during swimming
1748	i 've never been to cape hatteras have you ?	no i have never been but i know they are a strand of small islands in the atlantic ocean .
1749	are they close to new york or maine ?	no its closer to bermuda .
1750	oh that 's not where i thought it was at all lol ! ! so it 's a tropical place ?	it has long beaches , sand dunes , marshes , and maritime forests , so it has a unique topography .
1751	a forest how interesting ! i may have to look it up and plan a trip there one day !	i would love to visit there too but do n't take a ship as they have had 600 ships wrecked there !
1753	yes , it is practice of abstraining from the animal products	there are categories of veganism .
1754	there are different types of veganism some of them are lacto ovo , lacto vegetarian	dietary vegans " ( or strict vegetarians ) refrain from consuming animal products , not only meat but also eggs , dairy
1755	these vegans do not eat the dairy products , eggs or any other products	ethical vegan " is often applied to those who not only follow a vegan diet but extend the philosophy into other areas of their lives , and oppose the use of animals f
1756	veganism is a way of living whcih seeks to exclude as far as possible	we also have the vegetarian ecofeminism is an activist and academic movement which states that all types of oppression are linked and must be eradicated ,
1757	whenever i go to the fair , i have to get a corndog	what fair do you go to ? i love a corn dog deep fried with a thick layer of batter .
1758	i live in florida , so i go to the florida state fair . they are so yummy . they have chili corn dogs too . so good !	i usually get my fix at the texas state fair . turns out a patent was filed for the name in 1927 .
1759	wow , theyve been around for quite awhile then . i didnt know that . i just know that they are good	ketchup or mustard ? it was introduced to the us by texas germans .
1760	i usually do ketchup , but at the fair ive seen some crazy toppings including chocolate	that doesnt sound too good . its kind of weird that people spell it either corn dog or corndog .
1761	hmmm ive never thought about that . i think i spell it both ways . that is weird	i also never though about the fact that ir resembles corn . i always though it was called a corn dog because of the batter .
1763	interesting ! i 've never grown my own plants . what 's it like ?	i like to grow useful plants , like leafy greens , herbs , and tomatoes . it 's rewarding !
1764	i bet it is . do you usually eat what you grow or do something else with it ?	we eat what we grow . i just have a small garden , and many of the plants are in large and small containers .
1765	i see . i imagine it feels good to be self sufficient . maybe i 'll try it myself someday .	i consider gardening to be really relaxing . once the plants are actually planted , it 's just a matter of watering them and pulling weeds every now and again . try it !
1766	i definitely will . i need some more hobbies and that sounds like it could be very beneficial . hoping for good yields for your future crops !	there are lots of benefits . you get fresher food and you save money !
1768	i 've never had savory pudding . is it any good ? what flavors does it come in ?	i have n't ever tried it . it started as meats in a pudding . i would think they used pudding as we do gravy
1769	i do n't think that sounds very appetizing . i do n't think i would like that texture with my meat .	in the u . s . and canada we mean a sweet milky desert . that 's the way i 'd like to keep mine .
1770	definitely ! i could eat chocolate pudding every day .	over here made from scratch it 's usually boiled but most other places its baked
1771	i 've always just used the boxed mix . it 's good enough ! sometimes i make it with fruit juice and add chunks of fruit . so good .	yes , that sounds good ! a lot of people just use the jell o line of products , like you and i
1773	what year is your " re honda civic and are there any other changes	the civic is inbetween the honda fit and the accord . it is a newer model , it has upgrades that most cars nowadays have .
1774	oh what kind of upgrades i have a dodge charger i was looking at upgrading my car	it has front wheel drive , better interior space and it is becoming more fuel efficient .
1775	i always say the more fuel efficient the better gas is going up steadily .	yes it is always rising . the very first civic was made in 1972 but as a two door then a hatchback came that september .
1776	the civic has gone through alot of changes over the years , i hope that it maintains some of that classic flair to it .	i 'm sure it will , that is what makes it unique . it is constantly being rebadged for the markets overseas .
1778	wow ! 40 species ? that is a lot more than i would of expected . i can think of the bottlenosed dolphin	i think that 's the one i 've seen in florida . i saw a group of about 15 which they called a pod .
1779	i remember swimming with the dolphins when i was a child and thinking how human like they acted	swimming with dolphins would be great ! they were n't killer whales , the largest dolphins , were they ?
1780	no , these dolphins were much smaller . they seemed very happy and are friendly to humans	i do n't understand this . killer whales are considered dolphins , and they feed on fish , seals , and ... wait for it ... dolphins !
1781	i can see how they would be in the dolphin family . they are actually very social and have the similar features to dolphins	dolphins are supposed to be very smart , are n't they ?
1782	i love salsa dancing for exercise . it works up a sweat !	it 's hard to believe that salsa dancing is so popular in america . it originated all the way down in the caribbean .
1783	it 's a lot of fun . what else is interesting about it ?	the salsa 's movements are derived from several other dances ' forms , including puerto rican bomba and plena , cuban son , cha cha cha , mambo , and others !
1784	very cool . so it 's a mexture of all those ?	yes , but it actually originated in new york in the mid 1970s !
1785	really ? i 'm surprised it originated in the u . s .	i believe that was only one variant , as different regions have their own variations on salsa . some of the more known styles are cuban , puerto rican , cali colombia , l . a . , and new york .
1787	and it 's also home to bob marley . one of the greatest musicians of all time .	bob marley was one of the best singers to exist and also really helped push weed as something that is not a problem
1788	for that i am also very grateful . cannabis is a blessing to many people with many otherwise untreatable ailments .	medical cannabis is such an important tool , its nice that it is becoming something people dont think is bad anymore
1789	from sea to shining sea it 's becoming legalized . hopefully now there will be meaningful research into it 's benefits .	jamaica even has it legalized due to marleys influence , what a great island country
1790	jamaica has some amazing runners . it 's incredible how seemingly out of no where they became a nation with some of the best runners in the world .	yep , usain bolt is from the country jamaica and he is probably the best runner to ever live
1791	i have three small dogs ! they 're adorable .	they 're may be the best pet ! they were the very first species to be domesticated , as well . since then , they 've been selectively bred for more than a millennia ! this has been done to achieve certain behaviors , sensory capabilities , and physical attributes , of course .
1792	wow really ? i just bought mine from the breeder and did n't think too much about where they came from .	you choosing dogs as pets is wise . dogs being associated with humans has encouraged them to become uniquely attuned to human behavior , which has led them to be so much more better suited to co exist and be pets with humans over other canid species .
1793	yes , mine always seem to know when i am getting sick and they spend time with me .	i 'm glad to hear it . but of course affection is n't the only role they play . the serve in hunting , herding , pulling loads , protection , assisting police military , and also helping those who are handicapped or who need therapy !
1794	mine are only small , so i do n't know how much policing they will be doing . but i always wanted a big german shepard .	haha , understood . and yes , german shepherds are highly popular , as well . on another note , interestingly , new research has found that dogs have mutations to equivalent genetic regions in humans , where changes are known to increase sociability and lower intelligence !
1795	my dad wants to go kayaking but i dont now anything about it .	well it 's a pretty tough activity , physically i mean . just some background , a kayak is a low to the water , canoe like boat and you have a paddler who sits facing forward and uses a double bladed paddle to propel the boat .
1796	yeah i have heard that it is kinda dangerous .	it can be if you do n't know what you 're doing , the kayak was actually created thousands of years ago by the inuit believe it or not
1797	i did not know it was that old ! do you know anything else interesting about it ?	well speaking of the old kayaks , they were actually made of driftwood and sometimes whale skeleton was used to construct the frame !
1798	i thin my dads is carbonfiber i guess now they make them out of that .	i would imagine they 've become more advanced since then of course . especially since they became so popular amongst europeans by the mid 1800s .
1799	it 's summertime and i know snakes will be more active .	snakes terrify me ! i do n't like their elongated and legless bodies . they freak me out !
1800	me too ! i can n't stand them and i 've started to put mothballs around my home 's foundation .	i knew mothballs were pesticide but i was n't aware they helped to prevent snakes from entering .
1801	the national pesticide information center website do state it has little effect on them : but the act makes me feel better .	the national pesticide info center helps us by providing objective information on pesticides . i wonder if there is an effective method of preventing snakes from entering .
1802	i always try to make sure in the spring that there is n't a food source for rodents in the summer . the website does have that recommendation .	i will definitely keep that in mind . i live in a hot and humid location and i 'm sure we have tons of snakes around here !
1803	the humidity here in sc has increased dramatically over the years and i 'm seeing more black king snakes	i lived in charleston , south carolina for twenty years before moving here to florida . i did see a lot of snakes there !
1804	linkin park is my favorite band ! i even went to one of their concerts !	i love linkin park . i liked them in 199 when they first started .
1805	awesome ! i have a bunch of their songs on my mp3 player so i can listen to them when i go jogging !	i really like meteora in 2003 .
1806	that 's a great song ! all their songs are fantastic , but that one really stands out .	i like how they adapted nu metal and rap metal .
1807	me too i hope they never break up the band i hate when that happens !	there seventh album " one more light " is one of my favorites .
1809	i am too ! but i never really thought about being a carnivore !	yeah it is a good thing . animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores
1810	that 's really cool ! do you know any animals which would qualify as obligate carnivores ?	i think rats do , omnivores also consume both animal and non animal food
1811	that 's more like me ! i love meat , but i like vegetables too !	a carnivore at the top of the food chain is called a apex predator
1812	i dont eat meat	that 's interesting ... do you consider yourself vegetarian or vegan ? vegans do n't eat anything that contains animal by products .
1813	vegan	that 's great ! so am i . i enjoy going to vegan festivals to try out new foods and products . many festivals have great music !
1814	i also love music	the great thing about vegan festivals is that many times admission is free so that non vegans will come and check it out !
1815	yeah but do they really go ?	i 've brought many non vegan friends . they 've enjoyed the music and the food . it was eye opening for them ... edutainment at its best !
1816	that 's great	i appreciate going to vegan festivals because i know all of the products i 'm eating are strictly vegan . i can just relax and enjoy myself .
1818	oh yes i am it was a lot of fun !	awesome . i remember disco was hugely popular through the mid 1970s to the early 1980s . it really was a different time .
1819	it was a great time and the music was awesome as well	i remember listening to disco and doing the bump and the hustle on the dancefloor .
1820	yes i did those dances too and remember the disco lights lol	i really like the sounds of disco . the string sections , electric piano , and the electric rhythm guitar were so unique .
1821	yes and combine the music with a cool place and a disco light and it was a heck of a party	i wonder what disco was like when it was just house parties . they would make makeshift discotheques .
1822	i like to play video games . my favorite game to play right now is minecraft . do you play video games ?	i do n't play video games , implying any type of display device that produces 2 or 3 dimensional images .
1823	ok . have you ever played one ? maybe pac man or super mario ? many people like to play games on their phones these days .	i played mario kart a few times with my kids when they were younger on our wii .
1824	i love mario kart . the one that came out on super nintendo in the 1990s is still being played today . amazing how long it has been out .	my husband has an xbox now but i can n't play mario as it 's only at an arcade or the nintendo game systems
1825	yes , that is true . the best game for xbox is halo . showtime is going to make a new tv series based off it !	i do enjoy going to dave and busters there are n't many arcades around anymore due to the home game consoles .
1826	we have a dave and busters here which my kids love to go to . yes , when i was a kid i spent a lot of time in arcades . my parents would never let me get a console .	now i have used the kinect sensor for a few games that help with exercise , but it was more for the exercise than anything else .
1827	hello ! i heard you liked to go for walks with your corgi . i do n't know much about them . what can you tell me ?	well corgis are also called welsh corgis , for one thing .
1828	why is that ?	because the breed of dog originated in wales .
1829	do you know when that was ?	not really , but one interesting thing is that there are two different types of corgis .
1830	wow ! what is the other kind ? is it just as cute ?	well there are pembroke corgis and cardigan corgis as well .
1831	were they bred for a specific reason ? anything else you can tell me ?	both forms of corgis were bred to be herding dogs .
1833	i wouldnt do it . a lot of people find reasons not to return after that year .. they like the money .. in a relationship .. blah blah .. just go and get it done	yeah i feel you there but i just really feel like i need a break before graduate school .
1834	well whatever works for you . thats all that matters is what you want !	i 'm still so undecided , i do n't even know if i want to go to a private or public university or a liberal arts college .
1835	public university is the way to go	i think i agree with you on that one , maybe ohio state university
1836	michael phelps , the greatest swimmer ever	oh yes , he is the most decorated olympian of all time , with a total of 28 medals .
1837	when was he born ?	he was born june 30 , 1985
1838	how many medals has he won so far ?	the breakdown is as follows : olympic gold medals in individual events ( 13 ) , and olympic medals in individual events ( 16 ) . all together that will be 23
1839	lovely ! that 's a great record	my calculation is wrong , he has a total of 28 medals as i stated earlier
1840	how do you read ? for me , the process is tiring	of course it can be tiring being a complex " cognitive process " of decoding symbols in order to construct or derive meaning
1841	sometimes , i put my legs in water just to concentrate and not to sleep	how does that help since reading process requires continuous practice , development , and refinement .
1842	it helps by keeping one awake . but when one keeps practicing it , the person will get used to it	well , i am not sure how that helps but anyways reading requires creativity and critical analysis . so maybe that could be some therapy for it .
1843	exactly , but do you enjoy reading	of course yes and even extensive reading which is a way of language learning , including foreign language learning , through large amounts of reading .
1844	wow , you must be a genius . very intelligent	it is a good thing to learn a foreign language originally from another country .
1846	i am not sure i know them , are they like very small bulldogs ?	yeah exactly ! they were one of the most popular registered dogs in the united kingdom .
1847	they are pretty cute i think , are french bulldogs originally from the united kingdom ?	they were actually from the 1800s when they crossed bulldogs and ratters in paris .
1848	interesting , and what is their personality , are they playful ?	i 'm not sure , but they were mixed with terriers in order to reduce their size .
1850	oh i wish i had a pizza right now . i am calling pizza hut as we speak .	it can also be topped with veggies and many different meats . can also be made without cheese .
1851	i like mine with pepperoni and pineapple . just keep those anchovies away from my pizza .	in 2009 italy had a request to make the neopolitan pizza and to make it registered with the european union as a traditional dish .
1852	i did not know that . italy stole our pizza ?	there are independent stores and chains as well as cafes that serve pizza on their menu .
1854	wow , that is amazing ! beets are very nutritious . they are a great source of great source of vitamins and minerals such as folate , manganese , iron , vitamin c , vitamin b complex , copper , and potassium !	they are super healthy , but super yucky in my opinion . in the middle 19th century , they used beetroot juice to color wine . i wonder how it affected the taste ?
1855	the amish still use beets to make wine . they add plenty of sugar to mask that beety taste !	that 's smart of them ! you can harvest earlier and use the greens for eating , too . that might taste better .
1856	beets are also used to treat medical conditions such as liver disease . they truly are a miracle plant !	oh , they also are used to treat illnesses relating to digestion and blood issues .
1858	i think motorcycles are great , but i am concerned about their safety . what kind of motorcycle does your son want ?	he has n't decided yet , but i think it 's the lure of joining a motorcycle club and attending rallies lol
1859	well , look on the bright side , he might make lots of friends . have you ever been on a motorcycle ?	yes , but it has been several years . yes , he could meet lots of people at a motorcycle rally , days of riding and a huge social gathering .
1860	be sure to ask him to wear a helmet . will you educate him on safety ?	definitely . you asked what kind , and i think he really likes the indian scout and chief motorcycles , antique motorcycles from the 1940s
1861	the indian scout is great . it reminds me of something out of an indiana jones movie . i think your son wants to be a greaser !	he might lol ! it 's strange how motorcycles here are kind of a luxury item , but in developing countries , they are more utilitarian , because they 're cheap there and use hardly any fuel !
1863	how does she cope with it ?	she usually deals with her inner turmoil and nervous behavior by making tea or sitting alone for a little while reading .
1864	has she ever tried prescription medication or seen a psychiatrist to get some relief ?	she has n't tried any prescriptions , but she 's taken a few over the counter drugs to help . she has n't been able to see a psychiatrist .

1867	yes tell me why you wanted to be a veterinarian ?	well , there was once a time i did , but i 've wanted to be many things . but i 've always loved animals . especially cats .
1868	did you know cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche , and what else did you want to do ?	no i did n't . cats are amazing are n't they ? i 've always wanted to be a musician .
1869	why did you want to do that ?	because like many kids , i wanted to be a star . like aaliyah .
1870	who is aaliyah ?	an american singer . she also acted and modeled
1871	i love watching the sunrise . it 's such a nice way to start the day !	same here , it 's a bit of a misnomer though as the sun does n't actually move , it 's actually the earth rotating .
1872	that 's true ! i never thought about that ! what do you think the best place is to watch the sun come up ?	really any place with a great view of the horizon .
1873	i like to go down to the beach to watch . it 's so pretty to watch how the sky changes color !	i agree . i can see why it is a part of so many mythologies and religions .
1874	is it ? can you tell me more about how it 's involved in mythology ?	well in earlier times it was believed to be geocentric , aka the sun rotating around the earth .
1875	do you know how to play the guitar ? my father used to play but i 've never picked it up .	i do play a little but nothing major . i get a bit lost with the 6 strings and the frets .
1876	did you ever take lessons or just pick it up on your own ?	i had classes for a few months but my teacher lost me when he tried to explain how each freat is a semitone in the standard western system and that an octave has twelve semitones .
1877	well , you know more than i do . i do n't even know what a semitone is .	a semitone is a half tone and is called the most dissonant when sounded harmonically . it 's a bit complicated i would say but it 's common in western tonal music .
1878	i 'm not sure what that means but i will take your word for it . do you have a favorite guitarist ? i personally enjoy listening to slash from guns and roses .	yes i do like guns ' n ' roses . axl rose also sings for ac dc since 2016 and i do enjoy them !
1879	i did n't know that . i sort of thought he disappeared after the last guns and roses album in 2008	yes those bands rarely tour nowadays and ac dc lost their lead singer after a heavy night of alcohol consumption in 1980 but still kept going !
1881	that 's nice . where do you plan to travel ?	i plan on visiting the french riviera , that will be my starting point .
1882	the french riviera is nice . it 's not to far away from spain .	i was trying to decide between going to basque county or province of imperia in italy after
1883	never been to italy , but the basque country is nice , my mother is actually from mallorca	amazing ! i 'd be intimidated to learn the basque language with how isolated it is .
1884	i love to dance , though i just simply move to the rythm	dance is a performing art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences
1885	are there categories of dance , just wondering !	dance can be categorized and described by its choreography , by its repertoire of movements
1886	what other forms of movement exist ?	other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance like quality , including martial arts , gymnastics , cheerleading , figure skating , its depends on location and origin

1889	i have bad allergies and it is affected by dust . i am forever vacuuming ! are you affected by dust ?	not too much usually those particles come from sources like soil , pollution , etc .. so i can understand the irritation .
1890	it is really gross if you think about it . what is the best way to get rid of the dust in my home ?	vacuuming frequently and dusting but some homes have dust mites also and they can create a lot of dust .
1891	what are dust mites ? are they like bed bugs or something ?	they are basically microscopic arachnids that feed on dead skin cells but do n't live on humans .
1892	yuck ! are they hazardous to my health ?	well , they and their feces can also produce other allergens but they are heavy and so are not suspended in the air for long .
1893	will in home pest control sprays be affective in killing them ?	possibly but it may be difficult they are a nesting species and like dark , warm , and humid places . they say if your pillow is old , it could actually be 50 dust mites
1895	oh yeah i really like jeopardy and stuff like that , i guess those are trivia shows not game shows though .	the very first tv game show was called spelling bee , it was broadcast back in 1938 !
1896	wow all the way back in the black and white tv days !	game shows really took off in the 1950 ' s though . that is when they became a popular fixture .
1897	do you have any examples of some game shows from the 1950s ?	twenty one and the 64,000 question were both very popular .
1898	i 'm not familiar with either , can you describe the 64,000 question a bit for me ?	it was just a show were contestants were asked questions devised by the series writer edith oliver .
1900	that 's cool ! are you excited ? ?	yeah , i 've always wanted a motorcycle , but this similar to one , so it will suffice .
1901	how powerful is it ? does it go fast ?	somewhat , they go as fast as bicycles on public roads .

1903	guess what , i love lady gaga , lets dance is the greatest club song of all time . what you know about that ?	well i know that gaga began her musical career by performing songs at a lot ofopen mic nights and school plays . seems like a good portion of fans dont know that .
1904	yeah they think she was a celebrity overnight	yea they dont seem to realize becoming such a big star involved a lot of recognition and the right people seeing you perform , also seeing talent agents is a good way as well .
1905	yeah being connected it more important than being good especially in the generic pop music space .	indeed there was a ton of major events and trends in popular music in the 2000s and it took a while for pop music to catch on , i think thats why gaga was so popular .
1906	well she is definitely an odd character if you have ever hear her speak , but thats probably why llke her , but recently her music has n't been as good	i agree , she has been known for her unconventionality and provocative work lately and its not looking too good , shes also been experimenting with new looks and images for herself , have you seen the crazy stuff she wears ?
1907	she needs to get back to wearing meat and singing songs about poker faces	lol i agree , its hard to believe that song came out way back in september of 2008 , i still have the album 's too , it was her second big single
1908	i would love to own a golden retriever some day , i wonder if they are good family dogs ?	they are ! their breed is very friendly , and gentle . however do n't expect them to be good guard dogs .
1909	oh that is nice to know since i have little ones . are they too friendly to guard the household ha	if you want them to lick the burglar to death then sure !
1910	well then , haha , that might do the trick ! are these dogs easy to train ?	they are very easy to train ! they love water and can be trained to a very advanced level .
1911	they love water , oh they sound like the perfect dog to take with us to the beach , so they are natural born swimmers i assume	oh yes that would be good ! they have an undercoat that keeps them warm in the winter , and the top coat repels water !
1912	that is so interesting , it is like they were meant for water . do they shed a lot ?	yes they do , however if you keep them brushed every day or two it will n't be a problem !
1914	that sounds very interesting , is it difficult to learn to paint ?	it varies . for example , acrylic paint dries very quickly so you have to be confident with how you use it .
1915	oh i see , so it 's better to learn with a slower drying paint ?	yes , or if you use water based paints you can actually re wet them and make alterations after it has dried
1916	oh that sounds like a good option for beginners for sure .	yep . oil paint works well too , it dries very slowly . though it 's used more for buildings and metal structures than for art
1917	pizza is so delicious , do you know much about it ?	well pizza is a traditional italian dish consisting of a yeasted flatbread typically topped with tomato sauce and cheese

1927	i did n't realize it ws multinational ? so is there a walmart in france ?	i do n't know , but they do operate in brazil and canada .
1928	do they carry the same items at their brazil stores that they do in america ?	i do n't know , but walmart still operates as a grocery store there .
1929	ah , well i 'd imagine , especially in brazil , that they carry a lot of different food items . what other unique things do you know about walmart ?	i know that that walmart was the largest u . s . grocery retailer in 2016 .
1930	i can see that but i try very hard not to go there . the one in our town is really badly ran and you can never get any help if you need it .	maybe you should try one of the other 11,702 walmarts that operate in 28 countries .

1937	of course , the prius . where i used to live they are everywhere northern california . do you have one ?	i do , i thought since it had been around since the late 1990 ' s it was probably a great full hybrid electric car .
1938	everyone i know who has one loves them . i 'd like to get one , but will wait until my mitsubishi dies on me , then look at them . do you find them quite economical ?	i do , as it is one of the world 's top selling hybrids , others must as well .
1939	good point . with opec messing with oil outputs , they will probably become more popular than ever ! toyota also have a good reputation for trucks .	the tacoma came to the united states in the mid 1990 ' s to replace the hilux and is still popular today .
1940	my husband looked at buying a toyota truck , but went with a nissan instead the first non ford truck he 's ever bought . he likes it though .	that 's good he likes it . i have n't had a non ford truck as i am so happy with them ,

2063	yes , very filled with red tape . do you know who appoints them ( and me ) to the post ?	not really , but the federal courts have three levels so it could be any of them .
2064	well , the role is to hear and rule on constitutionality of lawss including disputes among parties and states	that 's right ! the supreme court is basically the last resort court since it is the highest in power and only used when necessary .
2065	and even then the cases they take a very limited in number !	i 've definitely noticed that ! have you noticed that there is no basic right of appeal that extends automatically to the supreme court ?
2067	oh yeah ! i do n't think it is new though as people have been doing it for centuries . :)	oh i didnt know that ! they have historically been regarded in the west as uncivilised and over the last 100 yeras the fashion has been associated with sailors , working men and criminals
2068	yes that is the stereotype for sure , lol . now it seems to be in fashion and more people are doing it .	yea well by the end of the 20th century many of the western stigmas of the tattoo culture had been dismissed
2069	yes it certainly appears to be . but i will never get a tattoo myself .	thats probably a wise move , the word is a loanword from the polynesian word " tatau " meaning to write
2070	i been thinking of getting a pet lizard . any idea on which i should buy ?	i would recommend a chameleon or gecko as they are very small . but if you are looking for a larger pet , go for the komodo dragon .
2071	nah i want a bigger one but not a komodo . any other ideas ?	well , there are draco , they live in the forest and are able to glide . not sure how they 'd make for a good pet though .
2072	is the draco a lizard ? how big do they get ?	yes they are a lizard . also known as a gliding lizard . they do n't get that big actually . the male is 195mm in length , female is 212mm .
2073	oh nice i will definitely look that up . thanks ! how about food , what do they eat	they are mainly carnivores . they will eat insects mostly , but the larger komodo will eat mammals as big as water buffalo !
2074	wow really ? ! ! ? that is scary . should i get a male or female ?	that 's your personal preference , there is no advantages to having one or the other . good luck !
2076	yes i 've used reading to learn several languages , it is great for that .	at first it was really hard to read the text , process it , and understand its meaning . but over time i got the hang of it .
2077	exactly , i wish i had develop the skill of fast reading , it would be so useful .	yea and a lot of people told me that understand the text , it was necessary for me to understand the spoken language first associated with the english text . but i kinda did it backwards .
2078	yes that have worked foe me too . but i usually get the basic first in a class and then begin reading .	thats how i did it mostly , but trying to recognize the english text helped me pronounce them better when i was learning the language from another person .
2079	yes that is a good idea , what other languages do you read ?	well when i read it really requires a lot of creativity and critical analysis so i am only trying to focus more on english , but my native language is chinese .
2080	hi ! have you ever been to syracuse ?	i have , and i can tell you so much about the great new york town .
2081	oh it is in new york ?	one of the most well known ones . were you referring to a different syracuse ?
2082	i just do n't know where it is located haha	yes , the one in new york is the largest city named syracuse
2083	that 's cool , what did you do ruting your stay ?	i was able to spend some time at the downtown convention complex
2084	i love 80s music . one of the best bands of that era was the pretenders , from england .	oh the pretenders ! i loved them ! the original band had lead singer and songwrite chrissie hynde , right ?
2085	that 's right she was lead vocalist and played rhythm guitar .	i thought so . she went on to launch a solo career in 2014 i think
2086	i 'd forgotten about that ! how did that go ?	i 'm not really sure , i do n't think it went well for her but i could be wrong . she was involved with early versions of the clash and the damned also
2087	now that i did not know . what a talented woman . did she win any awards with the pretenders ?	if she did n't she should have ! she was great with pete farndom , james honeyman scott and martin chambers .
2088	working at a brewery must be really cool .	of course its the place where beer is commercially made , i like to call it a beerhouse .
2089	i 'd brew at home if i knew how haha .	brewing was initially a cottage industry , most of all brewing was done at home !
2090	ohh cool , brewing is a really old thing after all so that makes sense .	brewing has taken place since the 6th millennium bc in ancient egypt and mesopotamia !
2091	damn , that 's way older than i even imagined !	sure is , and its been a major part of our economy since the 19th century and most western modern economies .
2092	i like sewing on the weekends .	yea that is the craft of fastening or attaching objects using stitches made with a needle and thread ?
2093	yeah . have you ever tried sewing before ?	yes because its one of the oldest of the textile arts , arising in the paleolithic era
2094	oh wow thats very dated back . do you know the exact date when sewing became about ?	i think for thousands of years .. and it was usually done by hand
2095	yeah i bet it dates very far back . is there anything else you can tell me about sewing ?	sewing was first used in teh 14th century
2097	i love chocolate . it 's really sweet .	chocolate can be in the form of liquid , paste , or a block .
2098	i 've never heard of chocolate paste . what is it like ?	cacao is cultivate by many cultures for chocolatae .
2099	what kind of cultures cultivate cacao ?	caocao flowers are pollinated by flies , rather than bees .
2100	what kind of flies ? why do flies pollinate it rather than bees ?	a pollinator is any animal that takes pollen from a flower and moves it to the female stigma .
2102	how does one become a vegan ?	like i said , you just have to stop eating or using animal products of any kind .
2103	are there different types of veganism ?	the first type is " ethical veganism " which is basically abstaining from the use of animals at all in any part of their life .
2104	is there a second type ?	the second one is " dietary veganism " which is not eating animals products but not caring about the use of animals .
2105	is there another type ?	there 's also " environmental veganism " which is the avoidance of animal products for the purpose of helping the environment .
2107	wow i love it too	a beauty salon , is an establishment dealing with cosmetic treatments for men and women .
2108	ok l will like to treat my hair how can l go about it	okay , but other variations of this type of business include
2109	what are they	hair salons and spas .
2110	please tell more	they are hair salons and spas .
2111	i will like to know moro	there is a distinction between a beauty salon and a hair salon
2113	really ? what genre do you want to write ?	some type of children 's book . i just have to find a subject kids would enjoy that has not already been done . since being an author you have to be the first person to create it .
2114	yeah . do you plan on doing the illustrations yourself or hiring someone ?	definitely hire someone . i can write but definitely not draw ! i will need someone also to help me with copyright since those laws are also very strict in the united states
2115	so you would hire a lawyer or how does that work ?	yes a lawyer would be able to help navigate all of the paperwork
2117	they are good at that ! i have two cats as well . are yours indoor or outdoor ?	mine are mostly outdoor , but sometimes they stay indoors when they 're feeling lazy like regular house cats .
2118	mine stay indoors , but i used to have a cat that loved going out every day . he caught all kinds of creatures . do yours eat dry food , canned , or both ?	i usually try to get them a mixture of both so they do n't get tired of regular cat food and to keep them healthy .
2119	that is what i 've heard is healthiest . do you worry about other cats , dogs , or wild animals attacking them when they 're outdoors ?	not really because there are n't many other pets in my neighborhood , and they have very sharp claws and quick reflex to protect themselves as you know .
2120	yeah , all the outdoor cats i 've had have been pretty good at defending themselves . i find that they are smart about running home when a larger animal is around too .	they 're certiainly smart creatures , and i think they have a good predatory sense so they probably know why they are being preyed upon themselves .
2121	the people 's democratic republic of algeria is in nigeria . i was wondering what kind of economy they have .	algeria is the 10th largest country in the world and the largest in africa .
2122	i knew it was the largest , but what is the economy like there ?	i actually am not sure about the economy .
2123	that is ok . do you know what kind of jobs they offer there that are different from the us ?	you have some tough questions ! there are several oil jobs ... from what i have read
2124	sorry about that i was just trying to learn more about that part of the world .	no , i totally get it . i can tell you they the country supplies large amout of natural gas to europe !
2126	i have . i 've been to a few parts of canada . i liked british colombia the best .	was it cold when you went ? most of the country has severely cold weather most of the time .
2127	i 've only been to british colombia in the summer so the weather was quite nice . i did , however , go to calgary once in the winter . that was the most spitefully cold place i 've ever been .	that 's alberta 's largest city ! was it crowded ? i 've never been there .
2128	it was n't particularly crowded . the restaurants were pretty good . basically it was like denver , colorado only much , much colder and not quite as populous .	when you went to denver did you get to see the rocky
2129	hi . i 'm thinking about getting the botulinum injections and would love to know more about them .	botulinum is a toxin produced by the bacteria clostridium botulinum .
2130	sounds a little scary , but i know people that have had it done and really like the results .	it can be used for therapeutic purposes . the first such use was to treat strabismus in 1981 .
2131	oh wow , really ? is strabismus the weak eye thing ?	yes . botulinum works by blocking neural impulses from muscles , and so causes muscle paralysis . this can be helpful in conditions where muscles are overactive .
2132	that sounds really interesting . what about restless leg syndrome ? can it help with that ?	yes . botulinum can relieve the uncomfortable sensations from rls .
2133	that 's really cool . i did n't know that the botulinum toxin had so many uses . thanks !	it can be used to treat a number of problems related to muscle spasms and diseases that are associated with overactive muscle .
2135	i work at a factory actually . do you know any kinds of factories ?	it is an industrial site usually consisting of buildings and machinery
2136	i see , do you know many factories there are in the u . s . ?	a plant manufactures goods by processing a product into another
2137	i have heard of sugar factories but was not aware it processed other products as well	factories arose during the industrial revolution
2138	i love driving through the blue ridge parkway . how about you ?	yes same here just because the highway is such a scenic beauty
2139	it sure is . do you know how far it goes ? or which states it 's in ?	yes , as they say it 's america 's longest linear park , it runs for through 29 virginia and north carolina counties .
2140	ah ! i think of them as the little mountains as compared to the rockies .	yeah , it would surprise you to know that it is the most visited unit of the national park system every year since 1946
2141	yes ! that is surprising . i did n't know it was a park .	now you know , the land on either side of the road is owned and maintained by the national park service
2142	i love coffee so much . i always drink it with cream and sugar , how about you ?	yes i love coffee and the fact that it is prepared from roasted coffee beans
2143	i have heard that you can roast your own beans at home , have you ever tried that ?	it would suprise you to know that the type coffea is native to tropical africa
2144	i have never heard of coffea . is that a type of coffee ?	coffea is a category of coffee . would you have imagined that it was exported from africa to countries around the world
2145	that is amazing ! what does the coffee taste like ?	today as we speak it is plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries including southeast asia , india , and africa
2146	it really is a worldwide business . i wonder how much coffee is drunk every year .	two of the most common and popular categories are arabic and robusta.arabica is less sophisticated but stronger and hardier robusta
2147	hi , i am a vegan . do you like to eat plant based meals ?	i have always been fond of abstaining from the use of animal products . i think it is moral issue
2148	what about it has made you come to that conclusion ?	the argument behind my decision that persuaded me to follow this way is the animal cruelty that i witnessed in the animal factories
2149	wow . i understand . it is very harsh . what about the health benefits ? do you think it is healthier for humans ?	well , you may miss important source of protein from vegan type of food intake . but i think it is worth doing for noble cause
2150	can we not get protein from other non animal sources ?	well , in today 's food industry , meat has been the main source of protein , but plants do contain protein too . only sufficiency of it is the concern
2151	what about b12 ?	i am quite sure we can get them from plant based food intake too
2152	i love golden retrievers . i think they are such loving and loyal dogs .	they are just beautiful . they are so easy to train to basic or advanced obedience standards . they are also always so happy to see you !
2153	yes . i think they are just about the best dog breed . they also love to play .	they really do . they are long coated with a dense inner coat this means they can play outdoors all day and it also repels water so they can go swimming .
2154	i think it 's neat how their special coat helps them to stay cool in the summer and warm in the winter .	true . they are so popular these days . they are the third most popular family dog breed in the us because of their friendly nature .
2155	that 's not a shock . it seems like there was a spike in popularity when the movie " air bud " came out .	you may well be right there . another great thing is that they are good for disability assistance dogs for the blind or deaf , due to their willingness to be trained and their good nature .
2157	did you win ?	i did not , but alex trebek was the host and i got to meet him !
2158	oh wow that is amazing . we do n't have that show here in the uk . how was it ? interacting with alex .	he is nice and i can see why the show has won thirty three daytime emmy awards and a peabody .
2159	why do you think it deserves those awards ?	it 's such a good show and was also ranked 45 on tv guide 's list of greatest shows one year .
2160	how many questions do you have to reply to to win the prize ?	i am unsure but i remember you had to say your answer as a question .
2162	me too ! is n't is fantastic !	of course it is various technologies , at a wide range of speeds
2163	how long have you had it ?	i have had it since when they were once rare for access
2164	so have i . do you play video games with it ?	i do not because of video game controversies
2165	children whose parent would divorce definitely suffers a lot in their entire life .	yes the dissolution of a marriage better known as divorce can cause issues with children for sure .
2166	divorce is not the solution for the conflicts between the family . many of them does not know the value of the relationship formed by the marriage .	i agree . also with all the legal issues that require the court to decide on child custody , asset distribution etc . divorce is a lot of pain and suffering .
2167	few years before , the children were does not aware and know about the word divorce . but now a days , it becomes a word we use in our daily life .	yes divorce is so commonplace nowadays . the custody of the children are awarded to the parent by a judge . they have the right to make decisions for the child .
2168	the couples who engaged in divorce , should think about the life and future of their children . if they do so , then there should some noticeable changes in their minds .	and sometimes they may be awarded joint custody , which is when both parties have custody , which could be confusing through the children .
2169	and some of the strict awareness program should be conducted for the couples . and their notice period for divorce should be made longer .	depending on where you live , divorce laws can be different .
2171	from what i know , it is one of the more common ones . i imagine it 's triggered by something , like a scary movie . do you know anything about yours ?	i 've always been more scared of imagined dangers that could be there , and not as much as the darkness itself .
2172	my cousin got his fear after watching ' it ' with the clown . i imagine it 's similar with you where you got scared at some point and never grew out of it	for me it was n't so much a movie , but just a general fear . i heard it 's pretty natural for kids to some degree . it can be a phase ... but i 'm still scared , so i guess not haha
2173	well i 'm not an expert so i suppose i do n't have the exact answer lol	yeah i do n't know either . the researchers sigmund freud said it was a manifestation of separation anxiety . i do n't recall separating from anyone though ...
2175	what type of diet do you think is best for weight loss ?	i think plant based is a good one . it will help with a reduction of body mass and give good sources of b12
2176	that is good to know . do you think there are any bad side effects from abstaining from meat ?	it is important to know the variations of vegetarianism and you can pick to eat eggs and dairy or not , so you can bypass side effects .
2177	that makes sense . i know there are many cultures in the world that are strictly vegetarian and seem to be very healthy .	this is true , and it can be adopted for many various reason , vegetarianism that is .
2179	disney is pretty cool . i live near orlando and it brings in so many people .	it is a great holiday destination since the first walt disney world opened in october 1 , 1971 .
2180	what is your favorite disney character ?	i would have to say bugs bunny . whats yours ?
2181	i like mickey mouse a lot . he is an icon .	mickey was created by disney and ub iwerks in 1928 .
2182	do you like donald duck at all ?	i do . i grew up watching all the disney characters and like them all as they are a part of my childhood . i do like how donald wears a sailor shirt and cap .
2184	oh wow ... are you completely colorblind or is it a specific type ?	not completely , no . i can still see colors , i just have difficulty with specific colors , like telling the difference between red and green .
2185	ahh i see . so what is that like ? is there a way to fix it ? i have heard that there are special glasses you can wear that will help .	so there is n't a cure , but since i was diagnosed with this disorder , i went to a specialist who taught me certain methods of coping .
2186	ahhh . what kind of methods do you use ? which ones work best ?	just learning to adapt ! like , for example little things that people take for granted , like telling the difference between stop red and green stop lights .
2187	interesting ! my wife is actually colorblind as well , but she has trouble seeing yellow and green . yellow is pink , and green is blue .	wow that 's weird ! i am a woman too , so it 's weird to hear about when other women are color blind . being color blind is more common in males , because females have two x chromosomes , and the defect for color blindness is usually on just one x chromosome so the other compensates .
2189	my uncle actually abused alcohol pretty hard in his younger days . it is a terrible situation to see .	it surely seems like it , not to mention all the bad effects , such as getting in risky situations like drinking and driving or unsafe physical encounters
2190	i agree , i think we have enough drunk drivers on the road doing enough damage .	that is why i like chackpoints , they are in locations where the incoming traffic cannot observe it until it is too late
2191	oh you mean sobriety checkpoints ? with the 4th of july coming up , i 'm sure there will be lots of those .	yeah , drunk driving is so dangerous , it is the leading mortality cause of people aged 15 29 in europe
2192	do you have anyone that has been in trouble for driving intoxicated ?	luckily i have not , i am glad my family has never put anyone in a tough spot that way
2194	no , i 've never been to new york or new york city ... always wanted to go . anywhere in new york would be cool , really . i 've heard of syracuse as a school , though . what do you like about it ?	you might be thinking of syracuse university or le moyne college ! both are great schools ! i love the whole feeling of the city , if that makes sense . it 's not over crowded , but not a small town .
2195	is there anything specific to culture or history related to syracuse that makes it unique ?	i think it 's neat that syracuse is named after a city on the eastern coast of sicily !
2196	oh , huh , i guess i never would have thought that was the case . i wonder why they chose that ! maybe there 's a big italian community there or something . what else specific can you tell me ?	in 2010 , forbes rated syracuse fourth in the top ten places to raise a family in the u . s . i guess i 'm not the only one who loves the city !
2197	that 's pretty nice .. i would never have guessed that , but maybe it makes sense in terms of cost of living , etc . wonder why they were rated highly . can you tell me anything else nice about syracuse ?	syracuse is great for conventions . there 's a really beautiful convention complex downtown ! it brings a lot of revenue to the city .
2198	how can you explain people can change emotional behaviors all of a sudden ?	sounds like it could be bipolar disorder . :(
2199	what do you know about it ?	its a disorder previously known as manic depression . it can cause periods of depression .
2200	i did not know that.depression ais a very serious consequence of bipolar disorder	sometimes , individuals poorly thought out decisions without thought of the consequences when they are feeling depressed .
2201	thats very sad.its difficult to deal with a love one with bipolar disorder	yes the periods of crying and negative outlook can be hard to work through .
2203	i love pizza . i like deep dish with lots of meat toppings .	me too ! i love the chicago deep dish . it 's amazingly stuffed with toppings . have you tried brick oven pizza ?
2204	no i have not but it sounds like it would taste very good . one thing i can n't stand is anchovies !	i see ! well there is such a variety of vegetables , meats , and condiments on pizza ! how about pineapple ? haha
2205	no i do n't like sweet toppings on pizza . give me vegetables and meats instead !	good call ! i 'm just glad the modern version of pizza exists ! it was created in naples .
2206	thank goodness for the italians or we would be missing out on this wonderful dish !	i agree ! thank you italy . in 2009 pizza was recognized as a speciality guaranteed dish !
2207	i like bob ross he is a great painter	bob ross is pretty cool , his real name is robert norman ross
2208	he was a very chill guy almost so nice and soft spoken	oh yes , his voice was very soft in his show " the joy of painting . " did you watch it ?
2209	i have not seen it yet but i want to	oh it 's great , it 's what turned his television personality into an internet celebrity in the 21st century !
2210	yeah i know a lot of kids are getting into him but that is a great thing	oh , yes , and as a child himself , he was very kind to animals ! is n't that sweet
2212	that sounds pretty bad .	yes it is . shellfish are not even fish , they are just water dwelling animals .
2213	not sure if i like shellfish or not . do they have specific names types i would recognize ?	you might be familiar with clams , mussels , oysters , or scallops . or maybe shrimp , lobster or crabs . i 'm allergic to them all !
2214	oh yes . i actually do eat those and like them .	that 's good that you can enjoy them . while you eat the shellfish , the shellfish eat a diet of phytoplankton and zooplankton . yum !
2215	hi , i 'm really interested in finding more about modern poets , what do you know about larkin ?	he was a poet , librarian , and novelist that was born back in august 9 , 1922 .
2216	ah so he would be over 90 if he was alive , what 's his most famous work ?	he had a lot of great works in his first book of poetry " the north ship "
2217	what were the themes about in the north ship ?	there were 5 poems about a ship 's progress northward .
2218	sounds interesting , i guess he was before his time in modern poetry with different themes to the traditional love poetry .	he was a very glum poet . he did write about romance , but it was with accuracy and truth , not romanticized .
2219	more of a realistic in comparison to traditional poets in history like wordsworth and so on a century or so before , yes ?	yes , exactly . people did enjoy his works which is why he received the queen 's gold medal for poetry .
2220	hi there ! i consider myself a cat person , i like them more than dogs how about you ?	i find myself more of a dog person ! i like their personality a bit more , but i know cats are just a valued for their companionship and their ability to hunt vermin !
2221	definitely ! my last cat was a great little mouser we never had a problem after she came along	that 's awesome . if you ever get another cat , which i hope you do , there are seventy different cat breeds recognized by cat registries ! hopefully it 'll keep the mouses out of your home !
2222	really ? i did n't know there were so many ! my father had a siamese when i was growing up she was beautiful	oh the siamese cat is one of the first distinctly recognized breeds of asian cat . they are super pretty and i love their squishy faces .
2223	me too they make such a wierd noise though !	yeah ! its a distinct noise with their distinct triangular head shape and large ears with a slender body ! they are not a breed to forget .
2225	purple is a nice color . i liked it a lot when i was younger !	that is cool . i love the fact that there are many variations to it to so it is a color you can have a lot of fun with .
2226	that is very true . i think it also goes well with any skin tone , so purple clothes could work for anyone !	you are so right my friend . i like how it is so regal too eve roman magistrates wore it .
2227	i forgot about it ! deep , rich purple certainly does have a very royal feel to it !	yes it does ! you know what 's funny though there is an english rock band called deep purple .
2228	is there ? i do n't know much about them . what are some of their songs ?	oh yes they are among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock . their album was called deep purple too .
2230	yoga huh ? back in the day , we just called it " stretching . "	thats hilarious , its actually physical , mental and spiritual practices that started in india
2231	ever heard of aikido ? it is a japanese martial art that incorporates many of the concepts of balance and energy that yoga teaches .	all i know about it is that its derives mainly from the martial art of dait ry aiki j jutsu
2232	yeah i think those were some of the martial arts previously studied by morihei ueshiba , the founder .	apparently he created it so that the person attacking could defend while also protecting the other person from injury
2233	i used to own ferrets . man i miss having them .	i bet . i have always wanted one especially since the name ferret is from the latin name meaning little thief . they sound like a handful !
2234	they sure our little theives they always hide stuff under the furniture .	what color was yours , i have always wanted a white one . i know they can live up to 10 years so like a puppy dog almost .
2235	mine were the typical brown ferret color . i loved it when they war danced .	they war danced ? i know they have been domesticated for thousands of years , what is their dance like ?
2236	that 's when they hope around like little idoits and play fight . i think the purpose in the wild is that they confuse their prey .	oh ok that makes sense . i know in some areas of the world they have rules with ferrets and keeping them . did you have any issue keeping it as a pet ?
2237	my oldest child just started elementary school , and he 's a bit nervous ! i do n't know what he should expect !	congrats that must be a big milestone ! i 'm sure he will be fine and learn a lot !
2238	well i hope they have high standards when they hire the teachers i want the best for my son !	yes with the best teachers your kid will be picking up stuff like algebra and grammar in no time !
2239	awesome ! but i am concerned about the security it 's not something that was a worry when i went to school , but times have changed , unfortunately .	i know what you mean , fortunately it 's not as prevalent as the media makes it seem . there are over 92k elementary school and kids are totally safe at almost all .
2240	that 's a relief ! when i went to school , elementary school went up to grade 8 has that changed ?	well it 's called middle school i think , but as late as 2001 6 8th grade were counted in elementary school staistics .
2241	are you in love with anyone ? any courtship ?	i love someone , but not courtship , since it is the time couple get to know each other , we are already married

2243	it seems like it 's always a good idea to keep acting as if you are courting the other person , so as not to appear that you take your relationship for granted .	yes i agree , i like it to keep it informal and private matter between two
2244	i think that in today 's dating atmosphere , people seem to spend less time courting each other and electronics get in the way .	yes , and i think couples should spend more time to see if they are romantically or sexually compatible

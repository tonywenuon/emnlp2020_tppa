are also similarities in processing linguistic and musical syntax in the brain	intervals can be arbitrarily small , and even imperceptible to the human ear	the circle of fifths is a sequence of pitches or key tonalities , represented as a circle , in which the next pitch ( turning clockwise ) is found seven semitones higher than the last	for example , c is adjacent to c the interval between them is a semitone	for example , c is adjacent to c the interval between them is a semitone	more specifically , it is a geometrical representation of relationships among the 12 pitch classes of the chromatic scale in pitch class space	cohemitonic scales contain two or more semitones ( making them hemitonic ) such that two or more of the semitones appear consecutively in scale order	when analysing the regularities and structure of music as well as the processing of music in the brain , certain findings lead to the question of whether music is based on a syntax that could be compared with linguistic syntax	some scales contain different pitches when ascending than when descending , for example , the melodic minor scale	in music theory , a distinction is made between a diatonic semitone , or minor second ( an interval encompassing two different staff positions , e	in music theory , a distinction is made between a diatonic semitone , or minor second ( an interval encompassing two different staff positions , e	" the oxford companion to music " describes three interrelated uses of the term " music theory " : the first is what is otherwise called ' rudiments ' , currently taught as the elements of notation , of key signatures , of time signatures , of rhythmic notation , and so on	a semitone , also called a half step or a half tone , is the smallest musical interval commonly used in western tonal music , and it is considered the most dissonant when sounded harmonically	a semitone , also called a half step or a half tone , is the smallest musical interval commonly used in western tonal music , and it is considered the most dissonant when sounded harmonically	c major consists of c , d , e , f , g , a , b , and the scale a semitone higher ( d major ) consists of d , e , f , g , a , b , c	a scale ordered by increasing pitch is an ascending scale , and a scale ordered by decreasing pitch is a descending scale	a tone cluster is a musical chord comprising at least three adjacent tones in a scale	a whole tone or major second is 2 semitones wide , a major third 4 semitones , and a perfect fifth 7 semitones	a whole tone or major second is 2 semitones wide , a major third 4 semitones , and a perfect fifth 7 semitones	a special subclass of the hemitonic scales is the cohemitonic scales	the recorder is a woodwind musical instrument in the group known as " internal duct flutes " flutes with a whistle mouthpiece	when transposing a mode of limited transposition this is not the case	tonality is the arrangement of pitches and or chords of a musical work in a hierarchy of perceived relations , stabilities , attractions and directionality	it is defined as the interval between two adjacent notes in a 12 tone scale	it is defined as the interval between two adjacent notes in a 12 tone scale	an equal temperament is a musical temperament , or a system of tuning , in which the frequency interval between every pair of adjacent notes has the same ratio	the purpose is to obtain justly intoned major thirds ( with a frequency ratio equal to 5:4 )	in music theory , a scale is any set of musical notes ordered by fundamental frequency or pitch	often , especially in the context of the common practice period , most or all of the melody and harmony of a musical work is built using the notes of a single scale , which can be conveniently represented on a staff with a standard key signature	to get closer to this question it is necessary to have a look at the basic aspects of syntax in language , as language unquestionably presents a complex syntactical system	the most common use of the term " is to designate the arrangement of musical phenomena around a referential tonic in european music from about 1600 to about 1910 "	in this system the perfect fifth is flattened by one quarter of a syntonic comma , with respect to its just intonation used in pythagorean tuning ( frequency ratio 3:2 )	the third is an area of current musicological study that seeks to define processes and general principles in music a sphere of research that can be distinguished from analysis in that it takes as its starting point not the individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is built	in equal temperament tunings , the generating interval is often found by dividing some larger desired interval , often the octave ( ratio 2:1 ) , into a number of smaller equal steps ( equal frequency ratios between successive notes )	in western music , intervals are most commonly differences between notes of a diatonic scale	in music theory , an interval is the difference between two pitches	it is the most prominent duct flute in the western classical tradition	music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music	an interval may be described as horizontal , linear , or melodic if it refers to successively sounding tones , such as two adjacent pitches in a melody , and vertical or harmonic if it pertains to simultaneously sounding tones , such as in a chord	the second is the study of writings about music from ancient times onwards	for instance , three adjacent piano keys ( such as c , c , and d ) struck simultaneously produce a tone cluster	transposing the diatonic major scale up in semitones results in a different set of notes being used each time	if music has a matchable syntax , noteworthy equivalents to basic aspects of linguistic syntax have to be found in musical structure	for example , in traditional japanese music , the anhemitonic " yo " scale is contrasted with the hemitonic " in " scale	the simplest and most commonly used scale in the world is the atritonic anhemitonic " major " pentatonic scale	in this hierarchy , the individual pitch or triadic chord with the greatest stability is called the tonic	in a 12 note approximately equally divided scale , any interval can be defined in terms of an appropriate number of semitones ( e	in a 12 note approximately equally divided scale , any interval can be defined in terms of an appropriate number of semitones ( e	the term ' fifth ' defines an interval or mathematical ratio which is the closest and most consonant non octave interval	due to the principle of octave equivalence , scales are generally considered to span a single octave , with higher or lower octaves simply repeating the pattern	a recorder can be distinguished from other duct flutes by the presence of thumb hole for the upper hand and seven finger holes : three for the upper hand and four for the lower	in music theory , the circle of fifths ( or circle of fourths ) is the relationship among the 12 tones of the chromatic scale , their corresponding key signatures , and the associated major and minor keys	in other words , there are equal ratios of the frequencies of any adjacent pair , and , since pitch is perceived roughly as the logarithm of frequency , equal perceived " distance " from every note to its nearest neighbor	the root of the tonic chord forms the name given to the key so in the key of c major , the note c is both the tonic of the scale and the root of the tonic chord ( c e g )
